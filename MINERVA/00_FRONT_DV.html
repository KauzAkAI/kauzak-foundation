PREFACE
Gold Coast thanks all of our current and former students who have helped us become the most prestigious construction school in Florida. Some of you may have obtained your licensing education from us back in 1970, while others may have received it recently. You are the reason we are in business. If there is anything that we can do to assist you, please ask.

We have strived to make the continuing education book enjoyable, informative, and relatable to day-to- day life. This year we are pleased to provide you with this correspondence course. The course syllabus is found on the next few pages.

As a Gold Coast student, we want to make sure that you are aware of the laws, rules, and codes that affect your license. While the following are not new law changes, they are nevertheless very important laws and rules you should be aware of to protect your license and avoid fines.

•	As you know, sole proprietors or partnerships cannot be exempt from the workers’ compensation insurance requirement. For corporations, the exemption is still allowed for up to three corporate officers who each own 10% or more of the company’s stock. Realize that a total of three exemptions is also the limit for any “affiliated” grouping of companies (companies where the same individuals have ownership).
•	“Advance Module” Building Code update courses remain a part of the CE requirement of most boards. Contractors need one hour; architects need two hours. Our program includes two of these “Advanced Module” hours.
•	Computer tracking is in place and 100% compliance is in force. The renewal of your license WILL NOT be issued until you have completed all of the required CE hours. The statewide system tracks license history, CE, and sanctions for both certified and registered contractors. It is important for you to establish an online account with the DBPR. You can do this by visiting myfloridalicense.com. Once your account is established, it is equally important to select the “Profile Merge” feature. This will ensure that informational changes to one license will be carried forward to all of your other licenses, if applicable.

We at Gold Coast School of Construction are working hard to keep up with these changes and look forward to being your professional education provider both now and in the future.

Thank you to the team that put this book together including all of our authors, editors, and designers. Sincerely,

Chris Clausing
Director of Construction
Gold Coast School of Construction,
