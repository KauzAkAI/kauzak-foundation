Chapter 1
WORKPLACE SAFETY
1
2	INTRODUCTION TO OSHA
3
4	OSHA Act of 1970
5
6	The Act: “To assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women; by authorizing
7	enforcement of the standards developed under the Act; by assisting and encouraging the States in their
8	efforts to assure safe and healthful working conditions; by providing for research, information, education,
9	and training in the field of occupational safety and health; and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the
10	Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that this
11	Act may be cited as the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act).
12
13	OSHA’s Mission
14
15	With the OSH Act, Congress created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to
16	assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing
17	standards and by providing training, outreach, education, and assistance.
18
19	The OSH Act was passed to prevent workers from being killed or seriously harmed at work. This law
20	created the OSHA that sets and enforces protective workplace safety and health standards. OSHA also
21	provides information, training, and assistance to employers and workers.
22
23	Under the OSH Act, employers have the responsibility to provide a safe workplace.
24
25	In the field of training, over 35 years ago, OSHA established the Outreach Training Program with the
26	introduction of OSHA 10 hours and OSHA 30 hours. Over the past several years, more than 1.6 million
27	students have been trained. Today, the outreach program has a national network of over 16,000
28	independent trainers.
29
30	Federal OSHA Coverage and Statistics
31
32	OSHA is an official entity where all worker’s complaints should be heard and addressed accordingly.
33
34	It is the agency responsible for providing research, information, education, and training guidelines for any
35	area related to occupational safety and health.
36
37	OSHA provides standards for many industries; however, for this course we focus on the standards
38	relative to the construction industry, 29 CFR 1903, 1910, and primarily, 1926.
39
40	5,333 workers died on the job in 2019 https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm (3.5 per 100,000 full-
41	time equivalent workers) — on average, more than 100 a week or about 15 deaths every day. About 20%
42	(1,061) of worker fatalities in private industry in calendar year 2019 were in construction – accounting for
43	one in five worker deaths for the year.
44
45	The 5,333 fatal occupational injuries in 2019 represents the largest annual number since 2007.
46	Fatalities in the private construction industry increased 5 percent to 1,061– the largest total since 2007. A
47	worker died every 99 minutes from a work-related injury in 2019
48
 
1	The following were the top 10 most frequently cited standards by Federal OSHA in fiscal year 2020
2
3	1. Fall Protection, construction (29 CFR 1926.501)
4	2. Hazard Communication Standard, general industry (29 CFR 1910.1200)
5	3. Respiratory Protection, general industry (29 CFR 1910.134)
6	4. Scaffolding, general requirements, construction (29 CFR 1926.451)
7	5. Ladders, construction (29 CFR 1926.1053)
8	6. Control of Hazardous Energy (lockout/tagout), general industry (29 CFR 1910.147)
9	7. Powered Industrial Trucks, general industry (29 CFR 1910.178)
10	8. Fall Protection–Training Requirements (29 CFR 1926.503)
11	9. Eye and Face Protection (29 CFR 1926.102)
12	10. Machinery and Machine Guarding, general requirements (29 CFR 1910.212)
13
14	Effectiveness of the OSHA Mandate
15
16	In more than four decades, OSHA and its state partners, coupled with the efforts of employers, safety and
17	health professionals, unions, and advocates, have had a dramatic effect on workplace safety.
18
19	Worker deaths in America are down on average, from about 38 worker deaths a day in 1970 to 15 a day
20	in 2019. Worker injuries and illnesses are down from 10.9 incidents per 100,000 full-time equivalent
21	workers in 1972 to 2.8 per 100,000 in 2019.
22
23	OSHA SAFETY STANDARDS - WHAT’S NEW?
24
25	The OSHA standards are contained in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) or written as “29
26	CFR.” OSHA provides standards for many industries; however, for this course we focus on the standards
27	relative to the construction industry, 29 CFR 1903, 1910, and primarily, 1926. These are the specific
28	OSHA standards that regulate and affect various types of work environments and activities:
29
30	•	Part 1926: Construction is regulated by Part 1926 that affects new construction, major renovation work,
31	and demolition work.
32	•	Part 1903: Part 1903 affects inspections, citations, and proposed penalties.
33	•	Part 1904: Part 1904 affects recording and reporting occupational injuries and illness.
34	•	Part 1910: Part 1910 affects general industry standards.
35
36	Each part is further subdivided into subparts that are organized alphabetically. Each clause starts with
37	1926 and is then divided into paragraph, then several sub-sub paragraphs. The typical example is
38	1926.453(a)(1)(i)[A]
39
40	Confined Spaces in Construction
41
42	New sections were added. This standard took effect in 2015.
43	Examples of locations where confined spaces may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:
44
45	•	Air Preheaters		Air Receivers
46	•	Boilers		Cesspools
47	•	Chillers		Concrete pier columns
48	•	Enclosed Beams		Heating, ventilation, and air
49	•	Incinerators		conditioning (HVAC) ducts
50	•	Lift Stations		Mixer Reactors
51	•	Pits (such as elevator, escalator, pump, equipment)		Water mains
52	•	Precast concrete and other preformed valve or other manhole units
53	•	Tanks (such as fuel, chemical, water or other liquid, solid, or gas)
54	•	Vessels
 

1	Cranes and Derricks in Construction: 1926.1427
2
3	This is a new section. There is a great push to have the crane operators certified. The deadline now is
4	December of 2018. Those involved with the use of cranes and derricks, please review this section and
5	the requirements. 1926.1427 Cranes and Derricks in Construction Operator Qualifications Standard was
6	amended and was made effective on 7th Feb 2019.
7
8	Beryllium in Construction and Shipyards: 1926.1124
9
10	The most recent changes to the rules for Beryllium in Construction went into effect on 9/30/2020,
11	however, the standard has been updated several times since 2018, mostly for clarity and to better
12	align with adjacent rules in 29 CFR 1910 General Industry.
13
14	Residential Fall Protection
15
16	OSHA is emphasizing and bringing great awareness for the requirement for Crystalline Silica Rule:
17	Construction. Implementation date June 23, 2017, Enforcement September 23, 2017.
18
19	EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITY
20
21	This is a short summary of key employer responsibilities:
22	Please remember that the prime contractor assumes all obligations prescribed as employer.
23	•	Provide a workplace free from serious recognized hazards and comply with standards, rules and
24	regulations issued under the OSH Act.
25	•	Examine workplace conditions to make sure they conform to applicable OSHA standards.
26	•	Make sure employees have and use safe tools and equipment and properly maintain this equipment.
27	•	Use color codes, posters, labels, or signs to warn employees of potential hazards.
28	•	Establish or update operating procedures and communicate them so that employees follow safety and
29	health requirements.
30	•	Employers must provide safety training in a language and vocabulary workers can understand.
31	•	Employers with hazardous chemicals in the workplace must develop and implement a written hazard
32	communication program and train employees on the hazards they are exposed to and proper precautions
33	(and a copy of safety data sheets must be readily available). See the OSHA page on Hazard
34	Communication.
35	•	Provide medical examinations and training when required by OSHA standards.
36	•	Post, at a prominent location within the workplace, the OSHA poster (or the state-plan equivalent
37	informing employees of their rights and responsibilities.
38	•	Keep records of work-related injuries and illnesses. (Note: Employers with ten or fewer employees and
39	employers in certain low-hazard industries are exempt from this requirement.
40	•	Report to the nearest OSHA office all work-related fatalities within eight hours, and all work-related
41	inpatient hospitalizations, all amputations and all losses of an eye within 24 hours. Call the OSHA toll-free
42	number 1-800-321-OSHA (6742); TTY 1-877-889-5627. [Employers under federal OSHA's jurisdiction
43	were required to begin reporting by January 1, 2015. Establishments in a state with a state-run OSHA
44	program should contact their state plan for the implementation date].
45	•	Provide employees, former employees and their representatives access to the Log of Work-Related
46	Injuries and Illnesses (OSHA Form 300). On February 1, and for three months, covered employers must
47	post the summary of the OSHA log of injuries and illnesses (OSHA Form 300A).
48	•	Provide access to employee medical records and exposure records to employees or their authorized
49	representatives.
50	•	Provide to the OSHA compliance officer the names of authorized employee representatives who may be
51	asked to accompany the compliance officer during an inspection.
52	•	Not discriminate against employees who exercise their rights under the Act. See the OSHA
53	"Whistleblower Protection" webpage.
54	•	Post OSHA citations at or near the work area involved. Each citation must remain posted until the
55	violation has been corrected, or for three working days, whichever is longer. Post abatement verification
56	documents or tags.
57	•	Correct cited violations by the deadline set in the OSHA citation and submit required abatement
 
1	verification documentation.
2
3	OSHA encourages all employers to adopt an injury and illness prevention program. These programs,
4	known by a variety of names, are universal interventions that can substantially reduce the number and
5	severity of workplace injuries and alleviate the associated financial burdens on U.S. workplaces. Also,
6	numerous employers in the United States already manage safety using injury and illness prevention
7	programs, and we believe that all employers can and should do the same. Most successful programs are
8	based on a common set of key elements. These include management leadership, worker participation,
9	hazard identification, hazard prevention and control, education and training, and program evaluation and
10	improvement.
11
12	SAFETY PROGRAMS
13
14	A written safety program is a very useful and essential tool to follow all OSHA requirements. It can also
15	provide a discount in your workers’ compensation insurance premium. If you don’t have one, we suggest
16	that you implement one. In Florida, you can take advantage of the easily available toolkit from the
17	University of South Florida found at:
18	https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/cohpe/usfsafetyflorida/our-online-applications/safetywriter
 




19
20	Also, we suggest that you buy an OSHA book for each of your supervisors as part of their hiring process
21	and make it mandatory. You will surely see the difference.
22
23	Important topics to include in a safety program are:
24
25	•	Control and prevention hazards		Emergency response plans
26	•	First and CPR trained personnel		Goals and objectives of the program
27	•	Identification of potential hazards on the jobsite		Inspections, training, accident reporting and
28	investigation
29	•	Job hazard assessment		Management commitment
30	•	Personal protective equipment		Policies and procedures
31	•	Record keeping		Safety & health training, employee orientation
32	•	Unit safety responsibilities
33	•	Vehicle safety and use
34
35	Advantages of a safety program include:
36
37	•	Insurance Savings		Savings in lost time and productivity due to accidents
38	•	Good management tool to assure compliance
39	•	Enhancement of workers’ safety awareness
40	TOP 10 CITED STANDARDS
41
42	These statistics have been compiled from the Department of Labor as of December 2020.
43

6	suggest that you take the time to watch them. https://www.osha.gov/vtools/construction
 




7
8	SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE RESIDENTIAL FALL PROTECTION
9	POLICY
10	Fall is the major cause of injuries in construction. It is important that we review the requirements for
11	residential construction where, most of the time, supervision is minimal or missing.
12
13	Under the new directive, employers must follow 1926.501(b)(13). This rule states that, “… Each employee
14	engaged in residential construction activities 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected
15	by guardrail systems, safety net system, or personal fall arrest system …” or, by alternative fall protection
16	measures allowed under 1926.501(b) for particular types of work as outlined below:
17
18	•	1926.501(b)(2)(ii): Controlled access zones and control lines can be used for some leading-edge
19	applications.
20	•	1926.501(b)(4)(i) and (ii): Covers can be used to prevent workers from falling through holes.
21	•	1926.501(b)(5): Positioning devices can be used while working on the face of formwork or reinforcing
22	steel.
23	•	1926.501(b)(7)(i) and (ii): Barricades, fences and covers can be used to prevent workers from falling into
24	excavations.
25	•	1926.501(b)(8)(i): Equipment guards can be used to prevent workers from falling into dangerous
26	equipment.
27	•	1926.501(b)(10): A combination of a warning line system and safety monitoring system can be used for
28	roofing work on low-slope (4:12 or less) roofs. Or, on roofs 50-feet (15.25 m) or less in width, the use of a
29	safety monitoring system without a warning line system is permitted.
30
31	If the employer can demonstrate that it is infeasible or creates a greater hazard to use the required fall
32	protection systems, the employer must instead develop and implement a written site-specific fall
33	protection plan in accordance with 1926.502(k). OSHA does not consider "economic infeasibility" to be
34	a basis for failing to provide conventional fall protection.
35
36	Note: There is a presumption that it is feasible and will not create a greater hazard to implement at
37	least one of the fall protection systems listed in 1926.501(b)(13).
38
39	OSHA expects that the fall protection methods listed in 1926.501(b)(13) can be used without
40	significant safety or feasibility problems for the vast majority of residential construction activities.
41
42	OSHA did not define residential construction in 1926.501(b)(13). STD 03-11-002 includes an
43	interpretation for the term “residential construction” for purposes of the standard.
44
 

1	Residential Construction Definition
2
3	In order to be classified as residential construction, two of the following elements must be met:
4	•	The end-use of the structure being built must be as a home, i.e., a dwelling.
5	•	The structure being built must be constructed using traditional wood frame construction materials and
6	methods.
7	•	The limited use of steel I-beams to help support wood framing does not disqualify a structure from being
8	considered residential construction.
9	•	The use of masonry brick or block in exterior walls are treated as falling within the scope of traditional
10	wood frame construction materials and methods.
11	•	Cold-formed metal studs will be considered within the bounds of traditional wood frame construction
12	materials and methods.
13
14	Residential Training Requirements
15
16	Under 1926.503, workers exposed to fall hazards must be trained to recognize potential fall hazards
17	and, in the procedures to be followed, to minimize those hazards.
18
19	Training must cover the following among other subjects:
20
21	•	The nature of fall hazards in the work area
22	•	How to erect, maintain, disassemble, and inspect the fall protection systems to be used
23	•	How to use and operate the fall protection systems to be used
24	•	Subpart M requirements
25	•	Supplements 1926.21
26	•	Prepare training certification.
27	•	Documentation of the latest training certification must be maintained.
28
29	Retraining for the following:
30
31	•	Changes in the fall protection systems to be used or to the workplace
32	•	Inadequacies in employee’s knowledge or use of fall protection indicates that retraining is necessary
33
34	RESIDENTIAL CONVENTIONAL FALL PROTECTION SYSTEMS
35
36	The following residential fall systems are outlined below.
37
38	•	Guardrail systems
39	•	Safety net systems
40	•	Personal fall arrest systems
41
42	Residential Guardrail Systems
43
44	Brackets for engineered guardrail systems can either be side mounted or deck mounted. Either way,
45	employers should look to the manufacturer instructions or the recommendations of a registered
46	professional engineer for proper installation.
47
48	Residential Safety Net Systems
49
50	These nets have been positioned to prevent falls to the interior of the building. Employers should consult
51	the manufacturer’s instructions and/or a registered professional engineer to ensure proper installation of
52	the net and bracing of the stud walls. Give due consideration to the potential impact load on the net and
53	lateral load on the stud walls in the event of a fall. [1926.402(c)].
 

1	Residential Personal Fall Arrest Systems
2
3	•	Anchor point: Anchorages used for attachment of Personal Fall Arrest equipment must be
4	capable of supporting at least 5,000 pounds per employee attached, or must be designed and
5	used as follows:
6	o As part of a complete personal fall arrest system which maintains a safety factor of at least
7	two.
8	o Under the supervision of a qualified person.
9	o Employer should look to the manufacturer’s instructions or the recommendations of a
10	registered professional engineer for proper installation. [1926.502(d)15)]
11
12	•	Residential PFAS full body harness: A full body harness distributes the force of the fall over the
13	thighs, pelvis, waist, chest, and shoulders.
14	o Body belts have not been allowed as part of an arrest system since January 1998.
15	o Residential PFAS Full Body Harness-Connector/Lanyard
16	o Snap hooks must be locking type. [1926.502(d)(5)]
17	o Never hook two snap hooks together unless designed for that purpose. [1926.502(d)(6)]
18
19	•	Residential personal fall restraint system: Although the standard does not mention personal
20	fall restraint systems, OSHA has previously stated that it accepts a properly utilized fall restraint
21	system in lieu of a personal fall arrest system when the restraint system is rigged in such a way
22	that prevents the worker from being exposed to the fall hazard.
23	o Fall restraint can be a body belt or full body harness.
24	o Must be tied off so that the worker cannot go past the unprotected side or edge, no matter
25	where the work is on the walking/working surface.
26	o Lanyards should be adjustable to take up slack when workers move about
27
28	•	Residential fall protection program - Other methods:
29	o Employers also have the option of having workers work from scaffolds (in compliance with
30	Subpart L), ladders (in compliance with Subpart X) or aerial lifts (in compliance with
31	1926.453) instead of complying with 1926.501(b)(13).
32	o Now we all know the first principle of mishap prevention is to “eliminate” the hazard whenever
33	possible. If you can’t eliminate it, you then have to minimize its effect. We cannot eliminate
34	working at heights in construction, but using ladders, scaffolds and aerial lifts can help
35	employers eliminate some falls from six feet or higher.
36	o Working at heights cannot be eliminated, but there are ways to minimize exposure to falls.
37	Assemble as many parts of the building as possible on the ground.
38		Properly assembled and braced IAW the manufacturer’s instruction and the
39	BCSI guide
40		Flying pre-assembled structures into place will minimize worker exposure to fall
41	hazards
42		Do as many things on the ground as possible
43		Some contractors are even pre-positioning portions of the guardrail system on
44	the ground
45		Pre-installed fall protection
46
47	Residential Fall Hazards - Prevention
48
49	Fall Protection Plan
50
51	If an employer can demonstrate that conventional fall protection is infeasible or presents a greater
52	hazard, the employer shall develop and implement a fall protection plan that complies with 1926.502(k).
53	The employer bears the burden of establishing that it is appropriate to implement a fall protection plan for
54	a particular workplace situation. [1926.502(k)]
55
56	The fall protection plan must meet all of the following requirements.
57	•	The plan must be written.
58	•	The plan must be site-specific.
 

1	•	A written fall protection plan developed for repetitive use, e.g., for a particular style or model of home, will
2	be considered site-specific with respect to a particular site only if it fully addresses all issues related to fall
3	protection at that site. Therefore, a standardized plan will have to be reviewed and revised as necessary,
4	on a site-by-site basis.
5	•	The plan must be prepared by a “qualified person.” [1926.502(k)(1)]
6	•	It must be developed specifically for the site where the residential construction work is being performed.
7	[1926.502(k)(1)]
8	•	It must be maintained up to date. [1926.502(k)(1)]
9	•	All changes must be approved by a qualified person. [1926.502(k)(2)]
10	•	It must be maintained on the site. [1926.502(k)(3)]
11	•	It must be implemented under the supervision of a competent person. [1926.502(k)(4)]
12	•	The plan must include documentation of reasons why conventional fall protection systems are infeasible
13	or create a greater hazard. [1926.502(k)(5)]
14	•	The plan must include a written discussion of the alternative work practices to be used that will eliminate
15	or reduce the possibility of a fall. [1926.502(k)(6)]
16	•	It must identify each location where conventional fall protection systems cannot be used and designate
17	them as controlled access zones (CAZ). [1926.502(k)(7)]
18	•	The plan must implement a safety monitoring system in conformance with 1926.502(h) where no other
19	alternative measure has been implemented. [1926.502(k)(8)]
20	•	It must identify all workers designated to work in the CAZ. [1926.502(k)(9)]
21	•	It must be reviewed and updated as appropriate if a fall, or near miss, occurs. [1926.502(k)(10)]
22
23	A sample plan can be found in Part 1926 Subpart M Appendix E on the OSHA Web site at:

28
29	In 1938, the Department of Labor produced a film titled "Stop Silicosis." Secretary Frances Perkins
30	concluded that silica dust was dangerous, but it can be prevented.
31
32	Silicosis is a form of occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust. It is marked
33	by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. It is a type of
34	pneumoconiosis.
35
36	The total deaths in the US due to Silicosis during the period between 2005 through 2014 was of 1,167
37	deaths, mortality rate is down from a high of 161 in 2005 to 84 deaths in 2014.
38
39	Those that were exposed didn't know then, and many still don't know now. For additional information,

41
42
43	About 1.85 million workers are currently exposed to respirable crystalline silica in construction
44	workplaces. Over 640,000 of these workers are estimated to be exposed to silica levels that exceed
45	OSHA's proposed permissible exposure limit (PEL).
46
47	These exposures occur during common construction operations, such as:
48	•	Drywall finishing using silica containing
 

1	•	Operating vehicle-mounted drilling rigs material
2	•	Rock Crushing
3	•	Tuck pointing
4	•	Using hand operated grinders
5	•	Using Heavy equipment during earthmoving
6	•	Using masonry saws
7	•	Using jackhammers
8	•	Using rotary hammers or drills
9
10	A proposed rule for new silica construction provisions is expected to save nearly 700 lives and prevent
11	1,600 new cases of silicosis per year once the full effects of the rule are realized.
12
13	Major Provisions of the New Silica Construction Standard
14
15	The new standard for silica construction that went into effect on September 23, 2017, includes provisions
16	for employers to do the following:
17	•	Measure the amount of silica that workers are exposed to if it may be at or above an action level of 25
18	μg/m3 (micrograms of silica per cubic meter of air), averaged over an eight-hour day
19	•	Protect workers from respirable crystalline silica exposures above the PEL of 50 μg/m3, averaged over an
20	eight-hour day
21	•	Limit workers' access to areas where they could be exposed above the PEL
22	•	Use dust controls to protect workers from silica exposures above the PEL
23	•	Provide respirators to workers when dust controls cannot limit exposures to the PEL
24	•	Offer medical exams, including chest X-rays and lung function tests every three years for workers
25	exposed above the PEL for 30 or more days per year
26	•	Train workers on work operations that result in silica exposure and ways to limit exposure
27	•	Keep records of workers' silica exposure and medical exams [1926.1153]
28
29	How to Control the Exposure?
30
31	Employers must use engineering controls and work practices as the primary way to keep exposures at or
32	below the PEL. Engineering controls include wetting down work operations or using local exhaust
33	ventilation (such as vacuums) to keep silica-containing dust out of the air and out of workers' lungs.
34	Another control method that may work well is enclosing an operation or "process isolation.” Respirators
35	are only allowed when engineering and work practice controls cannot maintain exposures at or below the
36	PEL.
37
38	For construction, the standard includes Table 1, a list of common construction tasks along with exposure
39	control methods and work practices that work well for those tasks and can be used to comply with the
40	requirements of the standard.
41
42	Please review the Table at the end of this section for the different ways in which to control exposure.
43
44	Regardless of which exposure control method is used, all construction employers covered by the
45	standard are required to do the following:
46
47	Establish and implement a written exposure control plan that identifies tasks that involve exposure and
48	methods used to protect workers, including procedures to restrict access to work areas where high
49	exposures may occur
50
51	Designate a competent person to implement the written exposure control plan
52	Restrict housekeeping practices that expose workers to silica where feasible alternatives are available
53	Offer medical exams, including chest X-rays and lung function tests every three years for workers who
54	are required by the standard to wear a respirator for 30 or more days per year
55	Train workers on work operations that result in silica exposure and ways to limit exposure
56	Keep records of workers’ silica exposure and medical exams
57
58	OSHA’s Crystalline Silica Rule (Construction)
 
1
2	Revised in 2020 – Provides a summary of the requirements of the respirable crystalline silica standard
3	for construction.
4
5	OSHA Directives: Inspection Procedures for the Respirable
6	Crystalline Silica Standards
7
8	New effective date: 06/25/2020 – The purpose of this Instruction is to provide guidelines and establish
9	uniform inspection and enforcement procedures for the respirable crystalline silica standards. The two
10	silica standards, 29 CFR 1910.1053 (General Industry and Maritime) and 29 DFR 1926.1153
11	(Construction), published in the Federal Register/ Vol. 81 No. 58/ Friday March 25, 2016, became
12	effective on June 23, 2016.
13
14	Significant Changes. This Instruction outlines the changes in enforcement due to the publication of the
15	silica standards in the Federal Register, 81 FR at 16285 (Mar. 25, 2016). The silica standards establish a
16	PEL of 50 µg/m³ and an action level (AL) of 25 µg/m³ for the three major forms of crystalline silica (i.e.,
17	quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite1 ) for the general, maritime, and construction industries.
18
19	The new PEL represents a change from the preceding PELs, which were based on formulas and were
20	inconsistent between industries and forms of silica. This change is particularly significant with regard to
21	the preceding PEL for the construction and shipyard industries, which was based on a particle count
22	method, expressed in terms of millions of particles per cubic foot (mppcf), and required the use of a
23	conversion factor to yield results reported in mg/m³.
