16	OVERVIEW HISTORY
17
18	USA
19
20	10th Century B.C. - Kings and Temples and Book of Genesis, first possible indication of a form of
21	workman's compensation
22
23	1855 - Georgia, passed the Employer Liability Act in the state legislature.
24
25	1855-1907 - 26 other states passed similar acts that simply gave permission to sue the employer if the
26	employee proved a negligent act or omission.
27
28	1897 - England repealed the Employer's Liability Act and replaced it with a Working Man’s Compensation
29	Act.
30
31	1898 - New York, the New York Social Club drafted a bill for the Partial Compensation for Workers. No
32	action was taken by the state legislature. The largest opponent was the labor unions.
33
34	1901 - Maryland passed legislation for a Cooperative Accident Insurance Fund.
35
36	1905 - The Maryland Act was ruled as unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court.
37
38	1908 - The Federal Employer's Liability Act was passed by the U.S. Congress at the urging of President
39	Theodore Roosevelt. This was the first workman’s compensation law in the U.S.
40
41	1911 - New York, Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire happened. Over 146 workers jumped to their deaths
42	to escape the fire in the ten-story building because the exits were blocked. This resulted in many lawsuits.
43	The entire nation was shocked by the tragedy. New York City immediately adopted the first safety codes.
44
45	1911 - Wisconsin became the first state to adopt a true workman's compensation law. It was called the
46	Great Trade Off. Employers provided coverage; employees gave up the right to sue.
47
48	1912 - Four more states passed laws.
49
50	1913 - Eight more states adopted legislation.
51
52	1915 - Alaska and Hawaii passed workman’s compensation laws even though they were only territories.
 
1
2	1935 - Florida passed the Workman's Compensation Law.
3
4	Florida
5
6	1935 - Florida’s Workman’s Compensation Law became effective.
7
8	1978 -1979 - Major changes in the state workers’ compensation system were underway in the state
9	legislature, the first major change since 1935. The fixed benefit system was replaced, and the Wage Loss
10	Concept was introduced. Workman's compensation was changed to workers' compensation.
11
12	1990 - The Division of Fraud and the first Drug Free Workplace were established.
13
14	Later - The Bureau of Safety was introduced. Managed health care, employee assistance office, and
15	emphasis on reemployment was introduced.
16
17	1993 - Wage loss was eliminated. Supplemental benefits, managed care, chiropractic care limits, and the
18	ombudsman office were created.
19
20	1999 - The special disability trust fund and division of safety were abolished.
21
22	2003 - The Department of Insurance and Banking merged to become the Department of Financial
23	Services.
24
25	The closing years of the 20th Century brought many changes especially as litigation and medical care
26	continued to be a problem not only in Florida, but throughout the nation as well.
27
28	Since that time, the law has undergone some drastic changes to adapt to all of the other changes that
29	have taken place in our society reflected by the numerous laws enacted by both the US and state
30	legislatures.
31
32	Legislative Intent
33
34	To assure the quick and efficient delivery of disability and medical benefits to an injured worker, an
35	efficient and self-executing system must be created that is not an economic or administrative burden.
36
37	To facilitate the worker’s return to gainful reemployment at a reasonable cost to the employer.
38
39	The Florida workers’ compensation system is based on a mutual renunciation of common-law rights and
40	defenses by employers and employees alike.
41
42	Workers’ compensation is a no-fault system meant to protect workers and employers. The idea of
43	workers’ compensation was to prevent employees from instituting private lawsuits against employers
44	based on common law. In exchange for providing those benefits, employers generally cannot be sued in
45	the court for causing injuries.
46
47	The Future …
48	We are just a few years into the 21st Century and have already seen sweeping changes with the
49	abolishment of the Department of Labor and Employment Security, the Division of Safety, and the Special
50	Disability Trust Fund. We saw many departments merging, created, and so on.
51	We saw the attorney-fee award structure, compliance, exemption, etc. introduced and modified to meet
52	the current needs.
53	Yes, there will be changes as we progress, but workers' compensation is still here for the citizens of
54	Florida.

1	LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO F.S. 440
2
3	Changes in 2014
4
5	In 2014, changes were made to House Bill (HB) 271, F.S. 440.107, .15, .16, .49.
6
7	Businesses had five days to respond to the state’s request for records. That was changed to ten days.
8
9	Information related to an employer's stop-work order should be made available on the Division's website,
10	be updated daily, and remain on the website for at least five years.
11
12	The amount of time investigators could review a company’s records for not having enough workers’
13	compensation insurance was changed from three to two years.
14
15	The multiplier for penalties levied was increased from 1.5 to 2.
16
17	Wherever the percentage of “66 2/3rd %” was changed to “66.67%”
18
19	The requirements and deposits were revised in that the Department must calculate the assessment rate
20	for the Special Disability Trust Fund by July 1 of each year.
21
22	Changes now allow companies to make a down payment of just $1,000 on their fine, have payment
23	arrangements for the rest, and arrange for insurance coverage. This was to allow businesses to continue
24	to function while aligning themselves with the law. First time offenders may receive a credit for the initial
25	payment of the estimated annual workers' compensation policy premium, to be applied to the penalty.
26	The $1,000 penalty will be assessed against the employer even if the calculated penalty after the credit
27	has been applied is less than $1,000. This is true even if the coverage is through PEO. Failure by the
28	employer to pay the penalty in full or enter into a payment agreement with the Department within 28 days
29	after service of the stop-work order will result in immediate reinstatement of the stop-work order.
30
31	Changes in 2016
32
33	April 2016 - The Florida Supreme Court overturned a law that had previously limited attorney’s fees in
34	workers’ compensation court cases. It took the case regarding workers’ compensation attorney’s fees
35	when a Miami man won an $822.70 compensation after being injured while working for a door making
36	company. The man’s lawyer, who spent 107 hours on the case, sought a fee of nearly $37,000, but was
37	only awarded $164. The dramatic difference occurred because at the time Florida only allowed attorneys
38	representing injured workers to be paid 20% of the first $5,000 in benefits received, and 15% of the next
39	$5,000.
40
41	April 2016 - The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) approved a statewide workers’
42	compensation insurance rate increase of 14.5% for businesses. The increase was to take effect on
43	December 1, 2016, to affect 2017.
44
45	Currently, temporary disability benefits limit the length of time disability payments can be received for a
46	single injury to two years (104 weeks). In a recent case, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that this two-
47	year cap is unconstitutional and increased it to a five-year cap (270 weeks).
48
49	Changes in 2017
50
51	New section F.S. 440.1851 Personal identifying information of an injured or deceased employee; public
52	records exemption
53	Effective: July 1, 2017
54
55	Synopsis: Personal identifying information of an injured or deceased employee, contained in records by
56	the Department of Financial Services, is confidential and exempt. Disclosure is authorized under specific
57	circumstances
58	Because of the extensive language in this change, you should access a document titled “2017 Workers’
59	Comp Legislative Changes to F.S. 440” on the DFS / Workers’ Comp website.
 
1	Maximum workers' compensation rate, effective January 1, 2018. $917.18 for the four calendar quarters
2	ending June 30, 2017. Subsection 440.12(2), Florida Statutes (2017), expressly provides that, for injuries
3	occurring on or after August 1, 1979, the weekly compensation rate shall be equal to 100% of the
4	statewide average weekly wage, adjusted to the nearest dollar, and that the average weekly wage
5	determined by the Department of Economic Opportunity for the four calendar quarters ending each June
6	30 shall be used in determining the maximum weekly compensation rate with respect to injuries occurring
7	in the calendar year immediately following.
8
9	Changes in 2022
10	Florida Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier has issued a Final Order granting approval to the
11	National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) for a statewide overall decrease of 4.0% for Florida
12	workers’ compensation insurance rates. This applies to both new and renewal workers’ compensation
13	insurance policies effective in Florida as of January 1, 2022.
14
15	Changes in 2023
16	Florida Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier has issued a Final Order granting approval to the
17	National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) for a statewide overall decrease of 8.4% for Florida
18	workers’ compensation insurance rates. This applies to both new and renewal workers’ compensation
19	insurance policies effective in Florida as of January 1, 2023
20
21	Changes in 2024
22	Florida Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier has issued a Final Order granting approval to the
23	National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) for a statewide overall decrease of 15.1% for
24	Florida workers’ compensation insurance rates. This applies to both new and renewal workers’
25	compensation insurance policies effective in Florida as of January 1, 2024

6	Employee Leasing Option
7
8	You, as an employer, may also consider leasing employees from a professional employer organization or
9	(PEO). In this circumstance, the PEO becomes the employer and provides workers’ compensation
10	coverage to each employee who is paid by the leasing PEO. This is a civil contract.
11
12	If you enter into an employee leasing agreement with a licensed employee leasing company, the
13	agreement should include workers’ compensation coverage only for employees listed with the employee
14	leasing company. You would be responsible for workers’ compensation coverage for all non-leased
15	employees.
16
17	The payroll for all leased employees must be paid through the leasing company. Any changes in job
18	duties or status of an employee must be reported to the leasing company promptly.
19
20	Advantages
21	•	Your rates will not be affected because you are new in business or have claims.
22	•	No headaches of quarterly reporting and worrying about premiums.
23
24	Disadvantages
25
26	Cannot hire direct laborers or workers for a short period of time.
27	Have to be very particular in sending the details of every worker and the job classifications.
28	Difficult to change the classification of the workers working in different classifications.
29	Complex situation and liability if one of your sub-contractor’s workers is not covered under the sub-
30	contractor’s insurance.
31	Individual Self-Insurers
32
33	An employer may become individually self-insured and secure the payment of workers’ compensation by
34	providing proof of financial strength necessary to ensure timely payments of current and future claims.
35
36	Authorization and regulation of individual self-insurers is through the Division. [F.S. 440.38]
37
38	Commercial Self-Insurance Funds
39
40	A group of persons may form a commercial self-insurance fund for purposes of pooling and spreading
41	liabilities for any commercial and/or casualty insurance.
42
43	Authorization and regulation of commercial self-insurance funds is through the Office of Insurance
44	Regulation. [F.S. 624.462]
45
46	WORKERS’ COMPENSATION EXEMPTION
47
48	An individual who meets the eligibility requirements to obtain an exemption pursuant to F.S. 440.05 may
49	elect to be exempt. [F.S. 440.05]
50
51	Sole proprietors and individuals cannot be exempted.
52
53	The exempted individual may not receive workers’ compensation benefits when they sustain a work-
54	related injury.
55
56	The applicant must be listed as an officer of the corporation in the records of the Florida Department of
 
1	State, Division of Corporations. The corporation must be registered with the Division of Corporations in
2	Florida.
3
4	Certificates of election to be exempt shall apply only to the corporate officer named on the notice of
5	election to be exempt and apply only within the scope of the business or trade listed on the notice of
6	election to be exempt.
7
8	The applicant must own at least 10% of the corporation.
9
10	A $50 application fee is required.
11
12	No more than three officers of a corporation (including an LLC) or of any group of affiliated corporations
13	may elect to be exempt from this chapter. [F.S. 440.02(15)(b)(2)]
14
15	A construction industry certificate of exemption issued by the Division is valid for two years after the
16	effective date stated thereon.
17
18	Exemptions are effective on the date they are issued by the Division.
19
20	Obtaining the Exemption
21
22	Obtaining the workers’ compensation exemption is an online process.
23
24	Access the Division of Workers’ Compensation’s Website:
25	myfloridacfo.com/division/wc/Employer/Exemptions/default.htm
26	Contact customer service at 1-800-742-2214 for any further information.
27
28	An exemption is subject to revocation if the person named on the certificate does not meet eligibility
29	requirements for an exemption. One can voluntarily revoke an exemption by filling out Form DWC 250-R
30	Form DWC 250-R Notice of Revocation to be Exempt
31
32	Exemption Advantages/Disadvantages
33
34	It is important to know the advantages and disadvantages of a workers’ compensation exemption,
35	especially when you see the following statistics. There has been a rise, which is a good indication of
36	construction growth. The rise in non-construction exemptions is due to the statutory change that defines
37	non-construction limited liability company members as “corporate officers,” that allows them to get the
38	exemption.
39
40	We all know the biggest advantage of the exemption is the monetary benefit. It is important to know the
41	disadvantages of the exemption.
42
43	So, only the disadvantages are listed here:
44	•	If you are injured, you are on your own.
45	•	If you hired a sub-contractor with the exemption and they hired a day laborer on a cash-payment basis
46	who gets hurt, you are responsible.
47	•	If anyone driving a company vehicle has an accident, the vehicle is covered under workers’
48	compensation, not the company’s automobile insurance.
49	•	Think of a scenario where your sub-contractor submits the proof of insurance for insurance that is through

28	WORKERS’ COMPENSATION EMPLOYER’S FAQS
29
30	Here are the most common frequently asked questions (FAQs) from employers regarding the workers’
31	compensation system.
32
33	Q: Who can I contact with questions or concerns regarding risk classification codes and premium
34	amounts?
35	A: Call your insurance carrier or service representative. If you have a dispute regarding the risk
36	classification codes, contact the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) at (800) 622-
37	4123
38
39	Q: Does the injured worker pay any part of my workers' compensation insurance premium?
40	A: The law is very specific on this point. It is the employer’s responsibility to pay the entire premium for
41	workers' compensation insurance coverage.
42
43	Q: What kinds of employee injuries are covered?
44	A: The law covers all accidental injuries and occupational diseases arising out of and in the course and
45	scope of employment. This includes diseases or infections resulting from such injuries. The law also
46	covers death resulting from such injuries within specified periods of time. Even if you do not think an
47	injury is covered, you must still file the First Report of Injury or Illness (DWC-1) with your insurance
48	carrier within seven days of your first knowledge of the accident/injury for determination of
49	responsibility.
50
51	Q: What injuries are not covered?
52	A: The law does not provide compensation for the following conditions:
53	•	A mental or nervous injury due to stress, fright, or excitement.
54	•	A work-related condition that causes an employee to be afraid or dislike for another individual because of
55	the individual's race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap.
56	•	"Pain and suffering" have never been compensable in Florida, nor is it compensable in any other state.
57	•	The employer may not sue an injured worker for causing a catastrophe nor can the injured worker sue the
58	employer for their injury. This trade-off makes it possible for injured workers to receive immediate medical
 
1	care, at no cost to the injured worker, without any consideration for who was at fault, the employer or the
2	employee. In civil law, negligence must be established through litigation before any compensation is
3	awarded. [F.S. 440.02(1)]
4
5	Q: Can an employer be liable for double compensation?
6	A: An employer can be liable for double compensation if a minor child is injured while employed in
7	violation of any of the conditions of the child labor laws of Florida. The employer alone, not the
8	insurance carrier, is liable for up to double the normal compensation as provided by the workers'
9	compensation law. To receive further information regarding the Child Labor Law, call the Child Labor
10	Office at (800) 226-2536.
11
12	Q: As a small business owner, can I be sued by an injured worker if I provide all the necessary care, light
13	duty work, and offer to retrain the employee?
14	A: Under the provisions of F.S. 440, an injured worker has two years from the date of the accident to file
15	a petition for benefits with the Division of Administrative Hearings. If an employer provides benefits and
16	return to work options, that should be sufficient to meet the ultimate goal of returning an injured worker
17	to gainful employment.
18
19	However, an employer/carrier's definition of "necessary care" and that of an injured worker may differ.
20	When that happens, the injured worker has no remedy except to file a petition for benefits and have a
21	judge of compensation claims determine whether the benefits that are being provided are sufficient, or if
22	additional benefits not being provided are required by Florida law. If the employer is providing benefits, all
23	expenditures must be reported to the employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier for statistical
24	purposes.
25
26	Q: What in the system would prevent an injured worker, who wanted to leave their employer anyway, from
27	claiming to be hurt, waiting out the treatment, still claiming to be hurt and then trying to settle?
28	A: By law, pain or other subjective complaints alone, in the absence of objective relevant medical
29	findings, are not compensable. However, sometimes these types of claims do occur, and they are
30	sometimes settled by insurance carriers for a nominal amount of money to rid the employer/carrier of a
31	nuisance case.
32
33	Q: Is compensation payable if an employee refuses to use a safety appliance like a hard hat, safety
34	goggles or observe a safety rule?
35	A: Compensation will still be paid, but indemnity benefits (partial wage replacement) may be reduced by
36	25% if the employee knew about the safety rule prior to the accident and failed to observe the rule, or
37	if the employee knowingly chooses not to use a safety appliance which the employer has directed him
38	to use. [F.S. 440.09(5))]
39
40	Q: Will becoming a drug-free workplace save me money on my workers’ compensation insurance
41	premium?
42	A: If you implement a drug-free workplace program in accordance with the criteria set forth in F.S.
43	440.102, you may be eligible for a 5% premium credit on your workers’ compensation insurance
44	premium. In addition to the premium credit, having a workers' compensation drug-free workplace
45	program may make your workplace safer, resulting in fewer accidents, which may reduce your
46	workers’ compensation costs.
47
48	Q: Under the workers’ compensation drug-free workplace program, can I conduct random drug testing of
49	my employees?
50	A: In addition to the situations in which testing is mandatory, the law does not prohibit a private employer
51	from conducting random testing or any other lawful testing of employees. A public employer may
52	institute random testing of employees in "safety sensitive" or "special risk" occupations.
