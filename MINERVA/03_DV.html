Chapter 3
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PRACTICES
1
2	INTRODUCTION
3
4	Providing excellent services or making superior quality services are essential ingredients in a successful
5	business. However, these alone do not guarantee success; they must be coupled with good business
6	practices. Your company and you, as its leader, take pride in the workmanship delivered to your clients
7	on a daily basis.
8
9	Just knowing your trade skills is not sufficient to guarantee success in any business enterprise. There are
10	other things that need to be addressed by an entrepreneur, if you are part owner, supervisor, or if you are
11	part of the management.
12
13	Statistics reflect that the USA is the country where the largest quantity of new enterprises is formed every
14	year, and it is also the same place that records the most quantity of bankruptcy filings in the same period
15	of time. Usually, it is not because the individual running the company does not know their trade, but
16	because they do not know how to manage it.
17
18	ESSENTIAL GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICES
19
20	The following ten essential good business practices should be the foundations of your craft or
21	construction business:
22	•	Self-assessment
23	•	Your potential as an entrepreneur
24	•	Planning
25	•	Know the regulations affecting your industry
26	•	Surround yourself with a good team
27	•	Assess your products/services
28	•	Know your market and competitors
29	•	Costing and pricing
30	•	Risk management
31	•	Keep good records
32
33	No two businesses are alike, but this is just a pattern that you may follow, and even though it does not
34	guarantee the road to success, it may point you in different directions that may help you solve some of
35	your business problems.
36
37	SELF-ASSESSMENT
38
39	So, you have determined you want to be your own boss. Commendable, but before you take that
40	important step, there are several things you need to address.
41
42	Do I have What it Takes?
43
44	As previously noted, knowing your trade does not necessarily lead to the road to success.
45
46	Am I ready to take on the additional hours and worries that being an entrepreneur carries?
47
48	As a supervisor working for someone else, you know that you will have a paycheck at the end of the
49	week, but you do not have to worry about running the business, sales, collections, payments to
50	employees, and suppliers.
51
52	But, as an entrepreneur, you will find that a great deal of your time will be spent in organizing and
 
1	directing the activities of the business and your employees. Unless you run your business organization as
2	well as you perform your field operations, you will find that everything is useless.
3
4	Personal audit: Undertake a personal audit or self-assessment to identify your strengths and
5	weaknesses.
6
7	Recognize your strengths and weaknesses: Work to recognize your strengths and address your
8	weaknesses. There is a great deal of help and assistance out there if you look.
9
10	Personal objectives: Recognize your reasons for becoming self-employed and be very clear about your
11	personal objectives and goals.
12
13	The duties of an effective manager include:
14	•	Planning
15	•	Organizing
16	•	Directing
17	•	Controlling
18	•	Standardizing
19	•	Assigning
20	•	Communicating
21
22	YOUR POTENTIAL AS AN ENTREPRENEUR
23
24	What is Entrepreneurship?
25
26	Entrepreneurship is the act of creating a business or businesses while building and scaling it to generate
27	a profit. However, as a basic entrepreneurship definition, it’s a bit limiting. The more modern
28	entrepreneurship definition is also about transforming the world by solving big problems. Like initiating
29	social change, creating an innovative product, or presenting a new life-changing solution.
30
31	What the entrepreneurship definition doesn’t tell you is that it is what people do to take their career and
32	dreams into their own hands and lead it in the direction of their own choice. It’s about building a life on
33	your own terms. No bosses. No restricting schedules. And no one holding you back.
34
35	Entrepreneurs can take the first step in making the world a better place, for everyone in it.
36
37	What is the Meaning of Entrepreneurship?
38
39	The meaning of entrepreneurship involves an entrepreneur who takes action to make a change in the
40	world. Whether startup entrepreneurs solve a problem that many struggles with each day, bring people
41	together in a way no one has before, or build something revolutionary that advances society, they all have
42	one thing in common - action.
43
44	It’s not some idea that’s stuck in your head. Entrepreneurs take the idea and execute it. Entrepreneurship
45	is about the execution of ideas.
46
47	Why Be an Entrepreneur?
48
49	Describe the rewards of going into business for yourself.
50
51	Describe the risks of going into business for yourself.
52
53	When you are considering owning your own business, an important first step is to analyze the advantages
54	and disadvantages of entrepreneurship.

33	The Reason People Become Entrepreneurs
34
35	The Entrepreneurship Appeal
36
37	With over 400 million entrepreneurs, entrepreneurship has an international appeal. Every entrepreneur
38	has their own reason that drove them to dive into being their own boss. Whether entrepreneurs need
39	more freedom or to make the world a better place, they all take control of their life by living life on their
40	own terms.
41
42	Now that we have discussed the advantages, disadvantages, the personal traits of an entrepreneur, and
43	you feel that, if you are one, you have made the right decision, it is commendable.
44
45	PLANNING
46
47	Planning is anticipating and taking advantage of business opportunities and problems. Planning requires
48	a great deal of time that often seems to take away from pressing day-to-day problems.
49
50	Suppose your boss asks you to organize a blood donor campaign. Is the objective to get as much
51	donated as possible? Or is it to raise the company profile? Deciding the real objectives will help you plan
52	the project.
53
54	Once you have defined the scope and objectives of the project, get the stakeholders to review and agree
55	to them.
56
57	The key to a successful business is planning your activities and projects from day one. Planning is about
 
1	making choices that should only be made based on good information. It requires the owner/manager to
2	decide which people, resources, and budget are required to complete a project.
3
4	The steps in preparing a business plan are as follows:
5	•	Define the scope and objectives
6	•	Define the deliverable
7	•	Determine a vision for the company
8	•	Determine a vision for the leadership
9
10	Define the Scope and Objectives
11
12	First, understand the company objectives. Deciding the real objectives will help you plan your activities.
13	Scope defines the boundary of the company objectives. Deciding what is in or out of the scope will
14	determine the amount of work that needs to be performed.
15
16	Understand who the stakeholders are, what they expect to be delivered, and enlist their support.
17
18	Define the Deliverable
19
20	You must define the deliverable, in other words, what will be delivered by the company over time.
21
22	Decide what tangible things will be delivered and document them in enough detail to enable someone
23	else to produce them correctly and effectively.
24
25	Key stakeholders must review the definition of deliverable and must agree they accurately reflect what
26	must be delivered.
27
28	Determine a Vision for the Company
29
30	No mystery here. The number one priority is the need to have a vision for the company and its future. It’s
31	critical that you, as the owner, have some clarity about what sort of construction company you want your
32	company to be and where you see your position in the market.
33	Where do you see yourself and your company in the next year, five years, and ten years from now?
34	•	What are your expansion goals?
35	•	What will your personal and company positions be in the local market in the future?
36	•	What are your needs, now, and in the future in regard to capital and labor sources?
37
38	All of these and similar questions should be addressed in your business plan. If you are to be the captain
39	of your ship, it is wise to plan your course before you leave the homeport.
40
41	Determine a Vision for Leadership
42
43	A close runner-up as a priority to the vision for the company is the vision for leadership that contractors
44	must have. As a contractor grows in size, they realize that they cannot be all things to all people or be
45	everywhere they need to be at the same time. Therefore, having the best field leaders leading the daily
46	charge in the field is crucial for a successful contractor.
47
48	Create a Sense of Urgency … Not Emergency
49
50	Emergency-based contractors wear out and lose employees. Having a sense of urgency in your company
51	actually inspires and energizes workers.
52
53	Creating a sense of urgency begins with you, the owner, communicating what your expectations are,
54	sharing the highs and lows of the company with your workers, and informing workers as to what your
55	customers want and expect from their performance.
56
57	Work on your leadership skills and make sure you understand the difference between leadership and
58	management. Good employees want to be led, not supervised.
59
 

1	KNOW THE REGULATIONS AFFECTING YOUR INDUSTRY
2
3	F.S. 489 provides for the licensure and regulation of all types of contractors in Florida. It is divided into
4	three parts:
5	•	Construction Contracting
6	•	Electrical and Alarm System Contracting
7	•	Septic Tank Contracting.
8
9	Another statute, F.S. 713, is the Florida Lien Law.
10
11	We will start the discussion of this topic of regulations affecting our industry by mentioning the necessary
12	disclosures affecting contracts. Both of these statutes contain provisions that mandate certain disclosures
13	or statements that must be included in construction contracts.
14
15	Some of the regulations governing our industry impact our contracts.
16
17	Contracts that Comply with State Law
18
19	You should have a copy of F.S. 489 on hand at your place of business. You can view a copy by visiting:
20	leg.state.fl.us/statutes/
21
22	The Florida Statutes contain provisions that mandate certain disclosures or statements that MUST be
23	included in construction contracts. Some of these provisions have dollar amount thresholds. Some
24	provisions must be included in each and every contract. Are there any that you are not familiar with?
25
26	The goal here is to orient your contracts so that they are consistent with state law. It includes operating
27	within the scope of your license and providing reasonable processes for dispute resolution. This includes
28	proper disclosures, such as the recovery fund disclosure in F.S. 489 and the lien law disclosure in F.S.
29	713. It also includes compliance with requirements outside the license law, such as the construction
30	defects law in F.S. 558.
31
32	Let us look more closely at each of these objectives
33
34	Basic Elements of a Contract
35
36	Writing contracts with the public that comply with state law should include the following elements:
37	•	Scope of work
38	•	Time frame
39	•	Price
40	•	Process for changes to the work
41	•	Process for close out and final completion
42	•	Successful business practices
43
44	These are the basic elements in a construction contract. Contracts are one of the most important
45	documents in a business. A poorly written contract between contractor and owner could be detrimental to
46	the business if these terms and others mandated by the statutes are not included in this document. The
47	absence of some of these disclosures may render your contract null in a court of law. The same attention
48	should be given to subcontracts between your company and a prime contractor.
49
50	Duty of Contractor to Notify Residential Property Owner of Recovery Fund [F.S.
51	489.1425]
52
53	Each agreement or contract for repair, restoration, improvement, or construction to residential real
54	property must contain a written statement explaining the consumer’s right under the recovery fund, except
55	where the value of all labor and materials does not exceed $2,500. The written statement must be
56	substantially in the following form:
57
58	FLORIDA HOMEOWNER’S CONSTRUCTION RECOVERY FUND:
 
1
2	PAYMENT UP TO A LIMITED AMOUNT MAY BE AVAILABLE FROM THE FLORIDA HOMEOWNERS’
3	CONSTRUCTION RECOVERY FUND IF YOU LOSE MONEY ON A PROJECT PERFORMED UNDER
4	CONTRACT, WHERE THE LOSS RESULTS FROM SPECIFIED VIOLATIONS OF FLORIDA LAW BY A
5	LICENSED CONTRACTOR. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE RECOVERY FUND AND FILING CLAIM,
6	CONTACT THE FLORIDA CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY LICENSING BOARD AT THE FOLLOWING
7	TELEPHONE NUMBER AND ADDRESS:
8
9	Mandatory Provisions for Direct Contracts [F.S. 713.015]
10
11	Any direct contract greater than $2,500 between an owner and a contractor, related to improvements to
12	real property consisting of single or multiple family dwellings up to and including four units, must contain
13	the following notice provision printed in no less than 12-point, capitalized, boldfaced type on the front
14	page of the contract or on a separate page, signed by the owner and dated:
15
16	ACCORDING TO FLORIDA'S CONSTRUCTION LIEN LAW (F.S. 713.001-713.37), THOSE WHO WORK
17	ON YOUR PROPERTY OR PROVIDE MATERIALS AND SERVICES AND ARE NOT PAID IN FULL
18	HAVE A RIGHT TO ENFORCE THEIR CLAIM FOR PAYMENT AGAINST YOUR PROPERTY, THIS
19	CLAIM IS KNOWN AS A CONSTRUCTION LIEN. IF YOUR CONTRACTOR OR A SUBCONTRACTOR
20	FAILS TO PAY SUBCONTRACTORS, SUB-SUBCONTRACTORS, OR MATERIAL SUPPLIERS, THOSE
21	PEOPLE WHO ARE OWED MONEY MAY LOOK TO YOUR PROPERTY FOR PAYMENT, EVEN IF
22	YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID YOUR CONTRACTOR IN FULL. IF YOU FAIL TO PAY YOUR
23	CONTRACTOR, YOUR CONTRACTOR MAY ALSO HAVE A LIEN ON YOUR PROPERTY
24
25	THIS MEANS IF A LIEN IS FILED YOUR PROPERTY COULD BE SOLD AGAINST YOUR WILL TO PAY
26	FOR LABOR, MATERIALS, OR OTHER SERVICES THAT YOUR CONTRACTOR OR A
27	SUBCONTRACTOR MAY HAVE FAILED TO PAY. TO PROTECT YOURSELF, YOU SHOULD
28	STIPULATE IN THIS CONTRACT THAT BEFORE ANY PAYMENT IS MADE, YOUR CONTRACTOR IS
29	REQUIRED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A WRITTEN RELEASE OF LIEN FROM ANY PERSON OR
30	COMPANY THAT HAS PROVIDED TO YOU A “NOTICE TO OWNER.” FLORIDA’S CONSTRUCTION
31	LIEN LAW IS COMPLEX, AND IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU CONSULT AN ATTORNEY.
32
33	Since the goal of F.S. 489 is to protect the public, actions that clarify relationships, actions that comply
34	with licensing requirements, and actions that advance safety and wellbeing would all be regulatory
35	measures.
36
37	As a contractor, you must be aware of the following statutes in order to stay in compliance with the law.
38
39	Disciplinary Proceedings [F.S. 489.129]
40
41	Committing mismanagement or misconduct in the practice of contracting that causes financial harm to a
42	customer. Financial mismanagement or misconduct occurs when:
43
44	Valid liens have been recorded against the property of a contractor’s customer for supplies or services
45	ordered by the contract for the customer’s job; the contractor has received funds from the customer to
46	pay for the supplies or services; and the contractor has not had the liens removed from the property, by
47	payment or by bond, within 75 days after the date of such liens;
48
49	The contractor has abandoned a customer’s job and the percentage of completion is less than the
50	percentage of the total contract price paid to the contractor as of the time of abandonment, unless the
51	contractor is entitled to retain such funds under the terms of the contract or refunds the excess funds
52	within 30 days after the date the job is abandoned; or
53
54	The contractor’s job has been completed, and it is shown that the customer has had to pay more for the
55	contracted job than the original contract price, as adjusted for subsequent change orders, unless such
56	increase in cost was the result of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor, was the result of
57	circumstances caused by the customer, or was otherwise permitted by the terms of the contract between
58	the contractor and the customer.
59
60	Monies Received by Contractors [F.S. 489.126]
 
1
2	A contractor who receives, as initial payment, money totaling more than 10% of the contract price for
3	repair, restoration, improvement, or construction to residential real property must:
4	•	Apply for permits within 30 days
5	•	Start the work within 90 days of receiving the permits, and
6	•	Continue through timely completion
7
8	Notice of Commencement [F.S. 713]
9	The wording for the Notice of Commencement has been amended:
10
11	“Warning to owner: any payments made by the owner after the expiration of the Notice of
12	Commencement are considered improper payments under Chapter 713…”
13
14	The preparation, filing, and posting of the Notice of Commencement are the owner’s responsibility or the
15	lending institution if there is a construction loan in the project, it never is the contractor’s responsibility.
16
17	The document must be posted at the jobsite, and that is also the owner’s responsibility.
18
19	On the permit card, the “Warning to Owner” print size has been reduced to 14-point, capitalized,
20	boldfaced type.
21
22	The sentence, “A Notice of Commencement must be recorded and posted on the job site before the first
23	inspection.” has been added to the Warning to Owner language.
24
25	If the project has a value of $2,500 or more, the NOC must be posted at the jobsite prior to calling for the
26	first building inspection.
27
28	SURROUND YOURSELF WITH A GOOD TEAM
29
30	You cannot do it all; no matter how much you try. Find the right people with the right skills and
31	personalities to be part of your team.
32
33	You are not the Energizer Bunny! Make sure you have a plan for recharging your batteries and keeping
34	up the motivation, you will need to make your dream business happen.
35
36	When you become self-employed, you become responsible for designing, producing, selling, customer
37	care, financing, collecting bad debts, bookkeeping, etc. But it is not essential that you undertake all of
38	these tasks unaided. It may be more cost-effective to allow professional and experienced people in
39	particular sectors to assume some ‘chores’ with which you are not comfortable and thus allow you the
40	time to undertake those with which you are, paying for their work from the increased turnover you are now
41	capable of earning.
42
43	Good practices to develop a good team of workers for your company include:
44	•	Provide on-going education and training for workers
45	•	Cross-train workers to build bench strength
46	•	Communicate the direction and goals daily
47	•	Create a work culture that enjoys and laughs
48	•	Institute a meaningful incentive plan
 

1	Provide On-Going Education and Training for Workers
2
3	“On-going” suggests a continuous effort to train whenever they can.
4
5	For the seasonal contractor, this might mean bringing their workers in a few days to a few weeks earlier
6	than opening day and taking them through a series of training topics.
7
8	Every contractor should be ready for those rainy days when grabbing an extra few hours on some
9	education would benefit the crews.
10
11	You are taking this course not only to comply with the continuing education requirements of your license,
12	but also to learn about new changes in the statutes, building codes, etc. affecting your license. Your
13	workers deserve the same consideration. On-going training and education on safety, new methods of
14	doing things, seminars conducted by speakers who will discuss these topics, will be most beneficial not
15	only to your employees but also to your company.
16
17	Cross-Train to Build Bench Strength
18
19	The greater diversity that your workers can handle, the easier time of scheduling you will experience.
20	Having more than one worker who can competently handle a paver, sealcoat machine, roller, or backhoe,
21	for example, the better chance your productivity will stay strong and profitable. This certainly is one of
22	signs of a successful construction contractor. Having workers who are able to step up and do additional
23	tasks is one of the necessities of a well-run organization.
24
25	We cannot be at the mercy of one of our essential employees getting sick or quitting, and now we have
26	become an emergency contractor again either having to shut down operations or hiring someone in a
27	hurry at exorbitant costs to the organization.
28
29	Communicate the Direction and Goals Daily
30
31	There is simply no excuse for not holding daily meetings with your crews.
32
33	Call them crew huddles or tailgate meetings but do them - daily! And set goals for the project, the day, or
34	the week -- whatever makes the most sense for your company and workers -- but setting targets always
35	comes back to inspire and refocus your workers.
36	This is another practice that will reap benefits for your organization, it has been proven numerous times
37	that employees seek a sense of belonging and participating in the company decisions more than an
38	increase in pay.
39
40	Create a Work Culture that Enjoys and Laughs
41
42	The most successful contractors, of any size, are all construction companies that enjoy people, celebrate
43	successes, and laugh a lot. The people at these organizations, from the owner to the lowest-paid laborer,
44	are just plain fun to hang out with. You can see the good-natured ribbing the workers dish out to their
45	foreman and, especially, to the owner.
46
47	You can keep people a long time with you if they enjoy you, the company culture, and are allowed to
48	laugh a little. A good supervisor is not afraid of laughing with and sharing good moments with their
49	employees. You as one of those type of supervisors, should be familiar with every one of your
50	employees, call them by their first names, ask them about their family and kids.
51
52	Remember, employees are looking for a feeling of belonging!
53
54	Institute a Meaningful Incentive Plan
55
56	OK, we finally see money showing up. Sure, money is important and the contractor who can creatively
57	reward performance with good pay and some form of bonus money will keep better workers around
58	longer.
59
 
1	There are a multitude of incentive-based compensation approaches, and they can be overly simple to
2	more complicated. Whatever path you follow, just be sure that your workers understand what it takes to
3	make that extra dollar. Yes, pay them what they are worth. Evaluate each one of them and give them the
4	rewards they deserve.
5
6	Personal evaluation of an employee is possibly one of the best tools a supervisor possesses to
7	communicate with them. Do not reward borderline employees, evaluate them, and be honest with them
8	then you will see that the majority of them change their attitudes and work habits. Some others will leave,
9	but then you are possibly lucky they left, and you did not have to fire them.
10
11	The most favored performance bonus is for gains made above what was set as a goal.
12
13	ASSESS YOUR PRODUCTS/SERVICES
14
15	Are you confident that your product is of a high quality in design and production?
16
17	Are you confident that there is a market for it?
18
19	Are you confident that your potential customers will pay the price you calculate necessary to meet your
20	costs?
21
22	These are some of the questions a contractor should ask about the company products and services.
23	Superior quality, timely production, and customer satisfaction are the qualities a successful contractor
24	must possess. A reputable contractor will be recognized in the industry and will be allowed, at times, to
25	obtain projects where their bid is not the lowest among the other bidders.
26
27	Measuring Construction Quality
28
29	Measuring quality is essential to improvement. With measurements, you can see trends, problem areas,
30	and gains made through improvement efforts.
31
32	KNOW YOUR MARKET AND COMPETITORS
33
34	One of the first questions people ask about a new idea or venture is, “Who is the competition?” Who else
35	is doing this? The worst rookie mistake in the world is to answer, “No one.”
36
37	There is always a competitor. Even if you cannot find anyone else who is doing what you are doing,
38	someone probably is thinking about it. And even if nobody is thinking about it, you’ll always have indirect
39	competitors, including the status quo and your customers’ thrift.
40
41	As an entrepreneur you should be aware of the market where you are operating.
42	•	Where are your services in that market?
43	•	How is your company reputation?
44	•	Who are your competitors?
45	•	How busy are they?
46	•	Do they have enough work that will allow you to increase your prices and get quality projects?
47
48	You will always have competition, and if you want to remain in business, you better get to know them!

50	It is essential that you know your market, as without this knowledge you cannot plan your route to market
51	or the means of promotion you will use to inform your customers of your existence.
52
53	It is also essential that you have a comprehensive knowledge of your competitors, as this knowledge will
54	allow you to distinguish what the market will stand plus identify the gaps in the market.
55
56	Market, being the geographical area as well as the type of services you are offering to the public, is an
57	essential part of being a successful contractor. By having a good knowledge of both market and
58	competitors you can develop a more effective marketing effort and successful costing and pricing
59	strategies.
 
1
2	One way in which to obtain knowledge is to join trade associations where you will be in touch not only
3	with competitors, but also with material suppliers, engineers, etc. who are familiar with the construction
4	environment and their input may be of great value.
5
6	Think about competition in three ways:
7
8	Barriers to entry
9	•	Competition often means that there is a barrier to entry: someone or something that stands
10	between you and your customers. Facing a barrier to entry does not necessarily mean that
11	another person or company is doing exactly what you are or that it has a specific barrier such as
12	a patent that impedes your entry.
13	•	If a customer’s needs are being met, there is a barrier.
14	•	Always ask, “What barriers to entry will I have to surmount?”
15	•	How is the customer’s need being met right now?
16
17	Differentiation
18	•	Failing to differentiate and set up barriers to competitors and imitators inevitably leads to profit
19	erosion. In this race to the bottom, the most efficient producers and the least profitable
20	competitors drive down margins to push out their competition.
21
22	Resources
23	•	Competitors are not just a problem; they are a great source of information and ideas.
24	•	The larger theme is the ordeal of what could be called commodity hell. The place where
25	executives find themselves when they cannot convince customers that their widgets or services
26	are better than those of their ever-burgeoning competitors. All they can say is, “Yep, we have
27	them too.”
28
29	Failing to differentiate will eventually land you in commodity hell.
30
31	COSTING AND PRICING
32
33	Costing and pricing are the most difficult tasks you need to address.
34
35	It is imperative that you know your break-even point: the number of units sold that will cover the costs of
36	your raw materials, overhead, and production time. Only when you know this figure (plus that of your
37	competitors), will you be comfortable in the knowledge of how high or low your price may go.
38
39	Calculating your break-even point is one of the most useful tools in the costing and bidding of your
40	operations. Your bookkeeper should be able to help you on that task. You should also know what your
41	different mark-up percentages for overhead are, profit.
42
43	How to Cost your Products
44
45	Be sure to price your work for the actual costs you will incur at the time you produce it.
46
47	If labor and material costs are expected to go up dramatically before the end of the year, allow for those
48	increases while preparing the cost of your products.
49
50	If you like the idea of an extended backlog of work, find a way to protect your planned profits from
51	escalating costs of material and labor.
52
53	During the good economic times, there is an abundance of work, so many sins go unnoticed and if you
54	are making money you might not bother to correct those sins.
55
56	You should have bidding policies for both types of economies: thriving and depressed.
57
58	If you must reduce your prices, do not reduce your actual costs. That should never be done. Play with
59	your profit markups and non-cash fixed overhead.
 
1
2	Be careful to watch your overhead expenses. Many construction businesses failed during the recession
3	because they could not cover the cost of the overhead they were committed to.
4
5	Know the cost of doing more business before you do more business, so you can use the right markup to
6	price your jobs profitably.
7
8	Before you increase your overhead costs, test the marketplace you plan to work in to make sure you can
9	sell at the increased pricing you will need and can sell enough work at that price.
10
11	Consider if you are in the right market to do business, but also if you have the right marketing and sales
12	skills in place.
13
14	Regardless of the type of economy in the industry, you should keep your overhead expenses low,
15	specially your fixed expenses.
16
17	Remember, those fixed expenses will be with you even in times when you have no backlog.
18
19	If you are planning on expansion or trying new services, before you increase your capital expenditures,
20	test the market to see if it warrants the additional expenditures.
21
22	Price your new products or services and test them in the marketplace to see the effect of the new
23	operation in your company wellbeing.
24
25	RISK MANAGEMENT
26
27	Risks are events that can adversely affect the successful outcome of a project or the company. Some of
28	those risks include:
29	•	Staff lacking the technical skills to perform the work
30	•	Hardware not delivered on time
31	•	Infractions of some of the statutes causing down time
32
33	Risks will vary for each company, but the main risks to an organization or project must be identified as
34	soon as possible. Plans must be made to avoid the risk, or, if the risk cannot be avoided, to mitigate the
35	risk to lessen its impact if it occurs. This is known as risk management.
36
37	People associate risk management with insurance. To some extent, that is correct, but there are some
38	risks that cannot be insured by obtaining an insurance policy. Some of the risks facing a construction
39	company are mentioned below. We should identify them and try to correct them before they happen.
40
41	Assign risk factors to those unforeseen events and assign priorities based on those factors, with high risk
42	factors being the most severe ones. Remember risks that are allowed to remain unchecked could spell
43	disaster for any company.
44
45	You do not manage all risks because there could be too many and not all risks have the same impact.
46	•	Identify all risks
47	•	Estimate the likelihood of each risk occurring (1 = not likely, 2 = maybe likely, 3 = very likely)
48	•	Estimate its impact on the project (1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high)
49	•	Multiply the two numbers together to obtain the risk factor
50
51	High risk factors indicate the most severe risks. Manage the ten risks with the highest risk factors.
52	Constantly review risks and lookout for new ones since they have a habit of occurring at any moment. Not
53	managing risks effectively is a common reason why projects and companies fail.
54	KEEP GOOD RECORDS
55
56	There is no mystery to bookkeeping. It is nothing more than a filing system of the day-to-day transactions
57	of your business. If you do not record and understand the transactions, your business will control you
58	rather than you are controlling it.
59
 
1	In addition to bookkeeping, we are compelled by the different statutes governing our industry to maintain
2	records of certain activities for a determined period of time.
3
4	As mentioned previously, “you cannot do everything needed in your company.” If it is a task that you are
5	not comfortable with, get help, there is plenty of it out there, just look for it.
6
7	A good outside bookkeeping service will take care of keeping the books to follow the regulations dictated
8	by the governmental agencies and keep you informed of the financial status of your company.
9
10	Business Records Requirements; Address of Record; Service [F.S.
11	489.124]
12
13	This statute reads in part as follows:
14	•	(1) All contractors who are registered or certified shall maintain complete financial and business records
15	for the immediately preceding 3 years. The business and financial records to be maintained shall include
16	minutes of corporate meetings, business contacts, telephone records, insurance policies, letters of
17	complaint, notices received from government entities, bank statements, cancelled checks, records of loan
18	documents, tax returns and all other business and financial records…
19
20	Revenue Recognition
21
22	In the construction industry, there are two accepted methods to record income:
23	The percentage of completion method
24	The completed contract method
25
26	The Percentage of Completion Method
27
28	In the percentage of completion method, income is generally recognized when work is performed and
29	recorded when statements are mailed.
30
31	Contractors sometimes receive payments for work not yet performed or only partially completed. The
32	portion of income above the degree of completion is said to be unearned in the accounting sense. It is not
33	earned and should not be recorded as income until the work is done.
34
35	When you receive cash for work that is only partially complete, you have to separate out the unearned
36	portion of income and assign it to a special account. That sum will be recognized as income later, after it
37	is earned. Then you remove it from the special account.
38	That special account, since it will reflect money received from the client that has not been earned, shall
39	be treated as a liability.
40	This is known as percentage of completion accounting because you recognize as income only that
41	portion of money received, or charges billed for work that is completed.
42
43	With this method, your financial statements give a fairly accurate picture of your financial position,
44	including expected profits or losses.
45
46	The advantage of the percentage of completion method is that income and the related costs, expenses,
47	and profits are recognized and reported as the job progresses.
48
49	The disadvantage of the percentage of completion method is that all income, costs, expenses, and profits
50	are only estimates until the job is completed.
51
52	Completed Contract Method
53
54	Recognizing income by the completed contract method has the advantage of exactness.
55
56	There is no need to estimate the degree of completion because all income is recognized only when the
57	job is 100% finished.
58
59	This method is always used for small jobs, such as one-time work, material sales, isolated minor
 
1	contracts, and any other job with a short duration.
2
3	Payment for such work is usually in one installment
4
5	You can use the completed contract method when you will complete the project within two years from the
6	contract date, and only if your annual gross receipts are under ten million dollars.
7
8	Discuss these methods with your accountant to determine which method is best suited for your company.
9
10	Preparing a Cash Budget
11
12	A cash budget must reflect business realities, since you use it to chart the future course of your operation.
13	There are two principal ways to prepare a cash budget or forecast:
14	•	The cash movement method
15	•	The source and application of funds method
16
17	The Cash Movement Method
18
19	The cash movement method involves budgeting only the flow of actual cash in and out of your business.
20	This method is especially valuable for builders who have wide variations in their business volume from
21	month-to-month. Such variation usually follows a predictable pattern.
22
23	Budgeting by the cash movement method lets you handle directly the cash flow changes that occur
24	because of monthly volume variations.
25
26	The Source and Application of Funds Method
27
28	The source and application of funds method is more precise than the cash movement method. It assumes
29	that you will attain a certain level of net income. Then it adjusts for non-cash changes to arrive at the net
30	increase or decrease in working capital.
31
32	Our recommendation is to discuss these methods with your accountant to determine which one is the
33	most beneficial for your company to utilize.
34
35	Cash Handling Problems and Solutions
36
37	In this section, we describe some of the problems that employers face with some employees whose
38	responsibility is to handle cash and collections. At the same time, we discuss some of the procedures
39	(solutions) that could be implemented to avoid them.
40
41	Lapping
42
43	Problem: Lapping is when cash is taken from the business by moving outstanding balances from one
44	customer account to another. The thief can write off the amount of cash taken as a bad debt, or they can
45	adjust the amount as a reconciling item to an out-of-balance system.
46	Solution: The way to prevent lapping is to insist on monthly accounts receivable aging lists of all
47	outstanding accounts. Compare this total to a reconciled accounts receivable total.
 

1	Unofficial Borrowing
2
3	Problem: An employee can take cash for periodic “emergencies” and intend to pay back what they
4	borrow someday. However, the employee is often tempted to take more and more until it becomes
5	impossible to repay. This becomes unofficial borrowing.
6	Solution: Establish office rules on petty cash and stringent control on all funds. Carefully monitor your
7	employees who have access to checking and savings accounts, and cash awaiting deposit.
8
9	Failing to Record Cash Sales
10
11	Problem: Sales made for cash are only reported if the sale is recorded. An employee who receives the
12	cash and records the sale has the opportunity to pocket the whole amount by failing to record the cash
13	sale.
14	Solution:
15	•	Set up an effective method of accepting cash
16	•	Use invoices for billings and orders, and fill out sales receipts for cash sales
17	•	File a copy of the invoice or receipt with the cash when it is received
18	•	Keep and be able to justify all voided receipts and invoices
19
20	Falsifying or Taking Discount Amounts
21
22	Problem: Falsifying or taking discount amounts is when an employee makes a purchase, gets a receipt
23	for the net amount, and then pockets the discount amount. Another way is when a bill has been paid in
24	full, but the vendor sends a refund for the discount and the employee pockets that amount.
25	Solution:
26	•	Know the discount terms of your suppliers.
27	•	Implement a monthly discount summary so that you can verify the terms used by your employees against
28	those quoted by your suppliers.
29
30	Taking Payments and Writing off Accounts as Bad Debts
31
32	Problem: Taking payments and writing off accounts as bad debts is when an employee receives a
33	payment for a small invoice, pockets the money, and then writes that amount in accounts receivable as a
34	bad debt.
35	Solution:
36	•	Approve all write-offs yourself
37	•	Never delegate this job to others
38	•	Prepare the bad debt analysis yourself for greater security
39	Financial Statements
40
41	Financial statements summarize your operation’s activity for a certain period, usually a month, quarter, or
42	year, and show its status at the end of that period.
43
44	There are three distinct financial statements:
45	•	Balance sheet
46	•	Income statement
47	•	Statement of cash flow
48
49	Balance Sheet
50
51	The balance sheet is a summary of the existing conditions of the business. It lists the assets (things you
52	own), liabilities (things you owe), and net worth of the business as of a given date.
 

1	Income Statement
2
3	The income statement summarizes business operations within a time period. The ending date of that
4	period is always the same as the closing date on the balance sheet.
5
6	The income statement is broken down into these standard divisions:
7	•	Sales - Revenues
8	•	Expenses - Costs
9	•	Net income from operations
10
11	Statement of Cash Flows
12
13	The statement of cash flows is a summary of the sources and uses of cash – where it came from and
14	where it went - for the same period covered by the income statement.
15
16	Funds are generally from the following sources:
17	•	Cash basis net income
18	•	Sale of assets
19	•	Increase in liabilities
20	•	Decrease of other assets
21
22	The application or uses of funds include the purchase of long-term assets (equipment), the decrease of
23	liabilities, and the payment of taxes.
24
25	Any time you change the sources or applications of your funds, you affect your current assets and
26	liabilities.
27
28	Tips
29
30	You are a link in the chain of the business; form good relationships with other links.
31
32	Be professional. You are the main asset of your business.
33
34	Indecisiveness wastes time. Gain knowledge and make informed decisions.
35
36	Getting finance is not easy. Acquire it wisely. Spend it wisely.
37
38	You may have an excellent product but, if you are not getting adequately paid for it, you are not in
39	business.
40
41	Research the market. Know your competitors.
42
43	Do what you say and say what you do.
44
45	Implement successful business practices.

10	needs to design around the key activities appropriate to its mission…”
