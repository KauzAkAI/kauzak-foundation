7	Legislature. Laws created by legislature are published in the Laws of Florida and codified in the Florida
8	Statutes.
9
10	State agencies publish regulations that are and must be consistent with the Florida Statutes. These are
11	published in the Florida Administrative Register (FAR). These are codified in the Florida Administrative
12	Code ( F.A.C) These are also called as administrative laws.
13
14	The Governor appoints various boards that create regulatory rules that are consistent with the state laws
15	and statutes. These board rules are codified in F.A.C.

21	any person certified by the appropriate board, or its designee, or the department when there is no board,
22	as having met the applicable requirements imposed by law or rule. However, an applicant who is not

24	examination. Upon a determination by the department that it erroneously issued a license, or upon the
25	revocation of a license by the applicable board, or by the department when there is no board, the licensee
26	must surrender his or her license to the department.

41	certification program.
42	(b)1. A conviction, or any other adjudication, for a crime more than 5 years before the date the application
43	is received by the applicable board may not be grounds for denial of a license specified in paragraph (a).
44	For purposes of this paragraph, the term “conviction” means a determination of guilt that is the result of a
45	plea or trial, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld. This paragraph does not limit the applicable
46	board from considering an applicant’s criminal history that includes a crime listed in s. 775.21(4)(a)1. or s.
47	776.08 at any time, but only if such criminal history has been found to relate to the practice of the
48	applicable profession.

55	current confinement or supervision.

57	the applicant is lawfully released from confinement or supervision and the applicant notifies the applicable
 
1	board of such release. The applicable board must verify the applicant’s release with the Department of
2	Corrections before it issues a license.
3	3. If an applicant is unable to appear in person due to his or her confinement or supervision, the
4	applicable board must permit the applicant to appear by teleconference or video conference, as
5	appropriate, at any meeting of the applicable board or other hearing by the agency concerning his or her
6	application.
7	4. If an applicant is confined or under supervision, the Department of Corrections and the applicable
8	board shall cooperate and coordinate to facilitate the appearance of the applicant at a board meeting or
9	agency hearing in person, by teleconference, or by video conference, as appropriate.
10
11	(d) Each applicable board shall compile a list of crimes that, if committed and regardless of adjudication,
12	do not relate to the practice of the profession or the ability to practice the profession and do not constitute
13	grounds for denial of a license. This list must be made available on the department’s website and updated
14	annually. Beginning October 1, 2019, each applicable board shall compile a list of crimes that although
15	reported by an applicant for licensure, were not used as a basis for denial. The list must identify for each
16	such license application the crime reported and the date of conviction and whether there was a finding of
17	guilt, a plea, or an adjudication entered or the date of sentencing.
18
19	(e) Each applicable board shall compile a list of crimes that have been used as a basis for denial of a
20	license in the past 2 years and shall make the list available on the department’s website. Starting October
21	1, 2019, and updated quarterly thereafter, the applicable board shall compile a list indicating each crime
22	used as a basis for denial. For each crime listed, the applicable board must identify the date of conviction,
23	finding of guilt, plea, or adjudication entered, or date of sentencing. Such denials must be made available
24	to the public upon request.

31	455.271 Inactive and delinquent status.
32
33	(6)(a) A delinquent status licensee must affirmatively apply with a complete application, as defined by rule
34	of the board, or the department if there is no board, for active or inactive status during the licensure cycle
35	in which a licensee becomes delinquent. Failure by a delinquent status licensee to become active or
36	inactive before the expiration of the current licensure cycle shall render the license void without any
37	further action by the board or the department. The board, or the department if there is no board, shall, by
38	rule, establish a reinstatement process for void licenses.
39
40	This subsection does not apply to individuals subject to regulation under chapter 473.
41
42	House Bill 447
43
44	489.103 Exemptions. - This part does not apply to:
45
46	(7)(a) Owners of property when acting as their own contractor and providing direct, onsite supervision
47	themselves of all work not performed by licensed contractors:
48
49	4. When completing the requirements of a building permit, where the contractor listed on the permit
50	substantially completed the project as determined by the local permitting agency, for a one-family or two-
51	family residence, townhome, or an accessory structure of a one-family or two-family residence or
52	townhome or an individual residential condominium unit or cooperative unit. Prior to qualifying for the
53	exemption, the owner must receive approval from the local permitting agency, and the local permitting
54	agency must determine that the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the project. An
55	owner who qualifies for the exemption under this subparagraph is not required to occupy the dwelling or
56	unit for at least 1 year after the completion of the project.
57
58	DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
59
 
1	4.   I understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I
2	may also build or improve a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or
3	residence must be for my own use or occupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale
4	or lease, unless I am completing the requirements of a building permit where the contractor listed on
5	the permit substantially completed the project. If a building or residence that I have built or
6	substantially improved myself is sold or leased within 1 year after the construction is complete, the
7	law will presume that I built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which violates the
8	exemption.
9	House Bill 7125
10
11	Section 19. Subsections (2), (3), and (4) of section 489.126, Florida Statutes, are amended, and
12	subsections (5) and (6) are added to that section, to read:
13
14	489.126 Moneys received by contractors.
15
16	(2)(a) A contractor who receives, as initial payment, money totaling more than 10 percent of the contract
17	price for repair, restoration, improvement, or construction to residential real property must:
18	1.(a) Apply for permits necessary to do work within 30 days after the date payment is made, except
19	where the work does not require a permit under the applicable codes and ordinances, and
20	2.(b) Start the work within 90 days after the date all necessary permits for work, if any, are issued, unless
21	the contractor has just cause for failing to apply for the necessary permits, starting the work, or refunding
22	the payment, or unless the person who made the payment agreed, in writing, to a longer period to apply
23	for the necessary permits or start the work or to longer periods for both.
24	(b)1. If a contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a), the contractee must make
25	written demand to the contractor in the form of a letter that includes a demand to apply for the necessary
26	permits, to start the work, or to refund the payment sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, mailed
27	to the address listed in the contracting agreement. If there is no address for the contractor listed in the
28	contracting agreement, or no written agreement exists, the contractee must mail the written demand letter
29	to the address listed for licensing purposes with the department or the local construction industry
30	licensing board, if applicable.
31	2. It may be inferred that a contractor does not have just cause if the contractor fails to apply for the
32	necessary permits, start the work, or refund payments within 30 days of receiving written demand to apply
33	for the necessary permits, start the work, or refund the payment from the person who made the payment.
34	(3)(a) A contractor who receives money for repair, restoration, addition, improvement, or construction of
35	residential real property in excess of the value of the work performed may shall not, with intent to defraud
36	the owner, fail or refuse to perform any work for any 90-day period or for any period that is mutually
37	agreed upon and specified in the contract.
38	(b) It is prima facie evidence Proof that a contractor received money for the repair, restoration, addition,
39	improvement, or construction of residential real property and that the amount received exceeds the value
40	of the work performed by the contractor when and that:
41	1. The contractor failed to perform any of the work for which he or she contracted during any 90-day 60-
42	day period or any period that is mutually agreed upon and specified in the contract;
43	2. The failure to perform any such work during the 90-day 60-day period or such period that is mutually
44	agreed upon and specified in the contract was not related to the owner’s termination of the contract or a
45	material breach of the contract by the owner; and
46	3. The contractor failed to perform for the 90-day period or such period that is mutually agreed upon and
47	specified in the contract without just cause or terminated the contract without proper notification to the
48	owner.
49	a. Proper notification of termination for purposes of this subparagraph must be made by the contractor in
50	the form of a letter that includes the reason for termination of the contract or the reason for failure to
51	perform sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, mailed to the address of the owner listed in the
 
1	contracting agreement. If no written agreement exists, the letter must be mailed to the address where the
2	work was to be performed or the address listed on the permit, if applicable.
3	b. If a contractor fails to comply with paragraph (a), written demand must be made to the contractor in the
4	form of a letter that includes a demand to perform work, or refund the money received in excess of the
5	value of the work performed, sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, mailed to the address listed
6	in the contracting agreement. If there is no address for the contractor listed in the contracting agreement,
7	or no agreement exists, the letter must be mailed to the address listed with the department for licensing
8	purposes or the local construction industry licensing board, if applicable.
9	c. It may be inferred that a contractor does not have just cause if the contractor fails to perform work, or
10	refund the money received in excess of the value of the work performed, within 30 days after receiving a
11	written demand to perform the work, or refund the money received in excess of the value of the work
12	performed, from the person who made the payment, for an additional 30-day period after the date of
13	mailing of notification as specified in paragraph (c), to perform any work for which he or she contracted,
14	gives rise to an inference that the money in excess of the value of the work performed was taken with the
15	intent to defraud.
16	(d)(c) Notification as contemplated in paragraph (b) consists of a certified letter, return receipt requested,
17	mailed to the address of the contractor as listed in the written contracting agreement. The letter must
18	indicate that the contractor has failed to perform any work for a 60-day period, that the failure to perform
19	the work was not the result of the owner’s termination of the contract or a material breach of the contract
20	by the owner, and that the contractor must recommence construction within 30 days after the date of
21	mailing of the letter. If there is no address for the contractor listed in the written contracting agreement, or
22	no written agreement exists, the letter must be mailed to the address of the contractor listed in the
23	building permit application.
24	(4) Any violation of subsection (2) or subsection (3) must be prosecuted in accordance with the thresholds
25	established in this section and the following: person who violates any provision of this section is guilty of
26	theft and shall be prosecuted and punished under s. 812.014.
27	(a) The required intent to prove a criminal violation may be shown to exist at the time that the contractor
28	appropriated the money to his or her own use and is not required to be proven to exist at the time of the
29	taking of the money from the owner or at the time the owner makes a payment to the contractor.
30	(b) It may be inferred that a contractor intended to deprive the owner of the right to the money owed, or
31	deprive the owner of the benefit from it, and inferred that the contractor appropriated the money for his or
32	her own use, or to a person not entitled to the use of the money, if the contractor fails to refund any
33	portion of the money owed within 30 days after receiving a written demand for such money from the
34	owner.
35	(c) In a prosecution for a violation of this section, the fact that the person so charged intended to return
36	the money owed is not a defense.
37	(5) A person who violates subsection (2) commits:
38	(a) A misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, if the total
39	money received is less than $1,000.
40	(b) A felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the
41	total money received is $1,000 or more, but less than $20,000.
42	(c) A felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the
43	total money received is $20,000 or more, but less than $200,000.
44	(d) A felony of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the
45	total money received is $200,000 or more.
46	(6) A person who violates subsection (3) commits:
47	(a) A misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, if the total
48	money received exceeding the value of the work performed is less than $1,000.
49	(b) A felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the
50	total money received exceeding the value of the work performed is $1,000 or more, but less than
51	$20,000.
 
1	(c) A felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the
2	total money received exceeding the value of the work performed is $20,000 or more, but less than
3	$200,000.
4	(d) A felony of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the
5	total money received exceeding the value of the work performed is $200,000 or more.

8
9	Section 4. Subsection (6) of section 489.503, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
10
11	489.503 Exemptions. - This part does not apply to:
12
13	(6)(b) - An owner of property completing the requirements of a building permit, where the contractor listed
14	on the permit substantially completed the project as determined by the local permitting agency, for a one-
15	family or two-family residence, townhome, accessory structure of a one-family or two-family residence or
16	townhome or individual residential condominium unit or cooperative unit. Prior to the owner qualifying for
17	the exemption, the owner must receive approval from the local permitting agency, and the local permitting
18	agency must determine that the contractor substantially completed the project. An owner who qualifies for
19	the exemption under this paragraph is not required to occupy the dwelling or unit for at least 1 year after
20	the completion of the project.
21	Disclosure Statement
22
23	State law requires electrical contracting to be done by licensed electrical contractors. You have applied
24	for a permit under an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of your property, to
25	act as your own electrical contractor even though you do not have a license. You may install electrical
26	wiring for a farm outbuilding or a single-family or duplex residence. You may install electrical wiring in a
27	commercial building the aggregate construction cost of which are under $75,000. The home or building
28	must be for your own use and occupancy. It may not be built for sale or lease, unless you are completing
29	the requirements of a building permit where the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the
30	project. …
31
32	House Bill 7125
33
34	Section 20. Subsections (7) through (10) are added to section 489.553, Florida Statutes, to read:
35
36	489.553 Administration of part; registration qualifications; examination.
37
38	(7) Notwithstanding any other law, a conviction, or any other adjudication, for a crime more than 5 years
39	before the date the application is received by the department or other applicable authority may not be
40	grounds for denial of registration. For purposes of this subsection, the term “conviction” means a
41	determination of guilt that is the result of a plea or trial, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld.
42	This subsection does not limit a board from considering an applicant’s criminal history that includes any
43	crime listed in s. 775.21(4)(a)1. or s. 776.08 at any time, but only if such criminal history has been found
44	to relate to the practice of the applicable profession, or any crime if it has been found to relate to good
45	moral character.
46	(8)(a) A person may apply to be registered before his or her lawful release from confinement or
47	supervision. The department or other applicable authority may not charge an applicant an additional fee
48	for being confined or under supervision. The department or other applicable authority may not deny an
49	application for registration solely on the basis of the applicant’s current confinement or supervision.
50	(b) After a registration application is approved, the department or other applicable authority may stay the
51	issuance of registration until the applicant is lawfully released from confinement or supervision and the
52	applicant notifies the board of such release. The department or other applicable authority must verify the
53	applicant’s release with the Department of Corrections before it registers such applicant.
54	(c) If an applicant is unable to appear in person due to his or her confinement or supervision, the
55	department or other applicable authority must permit the applicant to appear by teleconference or video
56	conference, as appropriate, at any meeting or hearing by the department or other applicable authority
57	concerning his or her application.
 
1	(d) If an applicant is confined or under supervision, the Department of Corrections and the department or
2	other applicable authority shall cooperate and coordinate to facilitate the appearance of the applicant at a
3	meeting or hearing in person, by teleconference, or by video conference, as appropriate.
4	(9) The department or other applicable authority shall compile a list of crimes that, if committed and
5	regardless of adjudication, do not relate to the practice of the profession or the ability to practice the
6	profession and do not constitute grounds for denial of registration. This list must be made available on the
7	department’s website and updated annually. Beginning October 1, 2019, and updated quarterly
8	thereafter, the department or other applicable authority shall add to this list such crimes that although
9	reported by an applicant for registration, were not used as a basis for denial in the past 2 years. The list
10	must identify for each such registration application the crime reported and the date of conviction, plea,
11	adjudication, or sentencing.
12	(10) The department or other applicable authority shall compile a list of crimes that have been used as a
13	basis for denial of registration in the past 2 years and make the list available on the department’s website.
14	Beginning October 1, 2019, and updated quarterly thereafter, the department shall add to this list each
15	crime used as a basis for denial. For each crime listed, the department must identify the date of
16	conviction, plea, adjudication, or sentencing. Such denials must be made available to the public upon
17	request.

20	House Bill 1247
21
22	Section 4. Paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 713.23, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
23
24	713.23 Payment bond.
25
26	(1)(d) In addition, a lienor who has not received payment for furnishing his or her labor, services, or
27	materials must be required, as a condition precedent to recovery under the bond, to serve a written notice
28	of nonpayment to the contractor and the surety. The notice must be under oath and served during the
29	progress of the work or thereafter, but may not be served not later than 90 days after the final furnishing
30	of labor, services, or materials by the lienor, or, with respect to rental equipment, later than 90 days after
31	the date the rental equipment was on the job site and available for use. A notice of nonpayment that
32	includes sums for retainage must specify the portion of the amount claimed for retainage. The required. A
33	written notice satisfies this condition precedent with respect to the payment described in the notice of
34	nonpayment, including unpaid finance charges due under the lienor’s contract, and with respect to any
35	other payments which become due to the lienor after the date of the notice of nonpayment.
36
37	The time period for serving a written notice of nonpayment shall be measured from the last day of
38	furnishing labor, services, or materials by the lienor and may shall not be measured by other standards,
39	such as the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or the issuance of a certificate of substantial
40	completion. The failure of a lienor to receive retainage sums not in excess of 10 percent of the value of
41	labor, services, or materials furnished by the lienor is not considered a nonpayment requiring the service
42	of the notice provided under this paragraph. If the payment bond is not recorded before commencement
43	of construction, the time period for the lienor to serve a notice of nonpayment may at the option of the
44	lienor be calculated from the date specified in this section or the date the lienor is served a copy of the
45	bond. However, the limitation period for commencement of an action on the payment bond as established
46	in paragraph (e) may not be expanded. The negligent inclusion or omission of any information in the
47	notice of nonpayment that has not prejudiced the contractor or surety does not constitute a default that
48	operates to defeat an otherwise valid bond claim. A lienor who serves a fraudulent notice of nonpayment
49	forfeits his or her rights under the bond. A notice of nonpayment is fraudulent if the lienor has willfully
50	exaggerated the amount unpaid, willfully included a claim for work not performed or materials not
51	furnished for the subject improvement or prepared the notice with such willful and gross negligence as to
52	amount to a willful exaggeration. However, a minor mistake or error in a notice of nonpayment, or a good
53	faith dispute as to the amount unpaid, does not constitute a willful exaggeration that operates to defeat an
54	otherwise valid claim against the bond. The service of a fraudulent notice of nonpayment is a complete
55	defense to the lienor’s claim against the bond. The notice under this paragraph must include the following
56	information, current as of the date of the notice, and must may be in substantially the following form:
57
58	NOTICE OF NONPAYMENT
59
 
1	To (name of contractor and address)
2	(name of surety and address)
3	The undersigned lienor notifies you that:
4	1. The lienor he or she has furnished (describe labor, services, or materials) for the improvement of the
 
5	real property identified as (property description). The corresponding amount now due and unpaid to date
6	is $	, of which $	is unpaid retainage.
7	2. The lienor has been paid to date the amount of $	for previously furnishing (describe labor, services,
8	or materials) for this improvement.
9	3. The lienor expects to furnish (describe labor, services, or materials) for this improvement in the future
10	(if known), and the corresponding amount expected to become due is $	(if known).
11
12	I declare that I have read the foregoing Notice of Nonpayment and that the facts stated in it are true to the
13	best of my knowledge and belief.
14
15	House Bill 7125
16
17	Section 28. Section 713.69, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
18
19	713.69 Unlawful to remove property upon which lien has accrued.—It is unlawful for any person to
20	remove any property upon which a lien has accrued under the provisions of s. 713.68 from any hotel,
21	apartment house, rooming house, lodging house, boardinghouse or tenement house without first making
22	full payment to the person operating or conducting the same of all sums due and payable for such
23	occupancy or without first having the written consent of such person so conducting or operating such
24	place to so remove such property. Any person who violates violating the provisions of this section shall, if
25	the value of the property removed in violation hereof is less than $1,000 be of the value of $50 or less,
26	commits be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s.
27	775.083; and if the value of the property so removed is $1,000 or more, should be of greater value than
28	$50 then such person commits shall be guilty of a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s.
29	775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.
30
31	House Bill 827 - Effective October 1, 2019
32
33	This bill effects the engineering profession as it amends F.S. 455 and F.S. 471 for reinstatement of void
34	licenses. Additional effects include:
35
36	•	It removes the requirement that all delinquent status licensees, licensed by the DBPR or a board
37	in accordance with F.S. 455 must apply for reinstatement with a complete application, and
38	instead, the bill requires boards, or the DBPR if there is no board, to adopt by rule a process for
39	reinstating applicants with void licenses.
40	•	It removes the requirement that engineers obtain a separate license (certificate of authorization)
41	for their engineering firm.
42	•	It requires a licensed engineer to qualify an engineering firm without paying a separate licensing
43	fee.
44	•	For a project that is wholly or partially funded by the department and administered by a local
45	governmental entity, the design services and construction engineering and inspection services
46	may not be performed by the same entity.
47	•	It provides an additional pathway for licensure as a professional engineer after receiving an
48	engineering technology degree.
49	•	It requires applicants for licensure to submit proof of being 18 years of age or older.
50	•	It requires the Board of Professional Engineers to extend certain deadlines for granting or
51	denying a license after an applicant fails to appear before the board.
52	•	It provides a temporary “registration” instead of a temporary “certificate” or “license” for out-of-
53	state engineering businesses.
54	•	It requires successor engineers to assume full responsibility when relying on the work, findings, or
55	recommendations of an engineer who previously sealed such documents and releases the
56	original engineer from liability for prior work assumed by the successor engineer.
57	•	It includes repair and restoration works in which a structural system or structural loading of a
58	building is modified. The enforcing agency shall require a special inspector to perform inspections
 
1	on a threshold building.
2	•	The local building official may not prohibit the private provider from performing any inspection
3	outside the local building official’s normal operating hours, including after hours, weekends, or
4	holidays.

22	House Bill 827 - Effective October 1, 2019 - Summary
23
24	Engineering technology degrees: Currently, only graduates with engineering sciences degrees from
25	board-approved programs are eligible for licensure in Florida. NOW graduates with bachelor’s degrees in
26	engineering technology from board-approved programs will qualify to apply
27
28	Decoupling experience and exam eligibility: Those who have passed the fundamentals of engineering
29	exam will be able to take the principles and practice of engineering exam before completing the years of
30	experience needed to apply for licensure.
31	a. Applicants with bachelor’s degrees in engineering sciences will still need four years of active
32	engineering experience to apply, but those with bachelor’s in engineering technology will be
33	required to have six years of active engineering experience.
34	b. Additionally, all applicants in Florida will have to be at least 18 Yrs.
35
36	Engineering firms: Engineering firms will not be required to apply for a certificate of authorization (CA)
37	and pay a fee. Firms must register their business with the board and be qualified by a professional
38	engineer licensed in Florida.
39	c.	Rather than renewing a CA every two years, the qualifying engineer of a firm must notify the
40	board within 30 days of any changes to information in the firm’s initial registration application.
41	d.   A qualifying engineer who leaves an engineering firm must notify the board within 24 hours. If the
42	qualifying engineer was the only qualifying agent for the business, the firm may no longer provide
43	engineering services in Florida and must be qualified by another qualifying engineer within 60
44	days if it wishes to resume offering engineering services.
45
46	Successor engineers: The new law requires successor engineers to assume full professional and legal
47	responsibility of engineering documents when assuming an existing project from another engineer. The
48	revision also releases the original engineer from professional responsibility and civil liability for prior work
49	assumed by a successor engineer.
50
 
1	Education waiver: A change to 471.013 removes a waiver that allowed someone with ten years of active
2	engineering experience who notified the DBPR before July 1, 1984, of their intent to seek a PE license,
3	and was engaged in engineering work on July 1, 1981, to apply for licensure without meeting the
4	education requirements. That original waiver is not valid after October 1, 2019.
5	Other changes that affect engineering: Design services and construction engineering and inspection
6	services CAN’T be performed by the same entity on projects receiving funding from the Florida
7	Department of Transportation that are administered by a local government entity.
8	e. Holders of a license issued by Florida that has gone null and void will be able to go through a
9	process to have their license and number reinstated.
10	f.	The new law expands requirements in F.S. 553.79. In addition to new construction, special
11	inspectors of threshold buildings will be required to inspect repair and restoration projects in
12	which the structural system or structural loading of a building has been modified.
13
14	2020 Legislative Update
15
16	This section outlines the 2020 list house and senate bills that made changes to Florida Statutes effecting
17	the construction industry
18
19
20	Senate Bill No. 1606.
21
22	An act relating to insurance administration; amending ss. 440.12 and 440.20, F.S.; authorizing the
23	payment of certain workers’ compensation benefits to be transmitted to the employee’s account with a
24	licensed money transmitter. Signed into law in June 2020 and becoming effective on July 1, 2020.
25
26	F.S 440.12 Time for commencement and limits on weekly rate of compensation.
27
28	(1) Compensation is not allowed for the first 7 days of the disability, except for benefits provided under s.
29	440.13. However, if the injury results in more than 21 days of disability, compensation is allowed from the
30	commencement of the disability.
31
32	All weekly compensation payments, except for the first payment, must be paid by check or, if authorized
33	by the employee, paid on a prepaid card pursuant to paragraph (b), deposited directly into the employee’s
34	account at a financial institution as defined in s. 655.005, or transmitted to the employee’s account with a
35	money transmitter licensed under part II of chapter 560.
36
37
38	F.S 440.20 Time for payment of compensation and medical bills; penalties for late payment.
39
40	(1)(a) Unless the carrier denies compensability or entitlement to benefits, the carrier shall pay
41	compensation directly to the employee as required by ss. 440.14, 440.15, and 440.16, in accordance with
42	those sections. Upon receipt of the employee’s authorization as provided for in s. 440.12(1)(a), the
43	carrier’s obligation to pay compensation directly to the employee is satisfied when the carrier directly
44	deposits, by electronic transfer or other means, compensation into the employee’s account at a financial
45	institution as defined in s. 655.005 or onto a prepaid card in accordance with s. 440.12(1) or transmits the
46	employee’s compensation to the employee’s account with a money transmitter licensed under part II of
47	chapter 560. Compensation by direct deposit, the use of a prepaid card, or through transmission is
48	considered paid on the date the funds become available for withdrawal by the employee.
49
50	(6)(a) If any installment of compensation for death or dependency benefits, or compensation for disability
51	benefits payable without an award is not paid within 7 days after it becomes due, as provided in
52	subsection (2), subsection (3), or subsection (4), there shall be added to such unpaid installment a
53	penalty of an amount equal to 20 percent of the unpaid installment, which shall be paid at the same time
54	as, but in addition to, such installment of compensation. This penalty shall not apply for late payments
55	resulting from conditions over which the employer or carrier had no control. When any installment of
56	compensation payable without an award has not been paid within 7 days after it became due and the
57	claimant concludes the prosecution of the claim before a judge of compensation claims without having
58	specifically claimed additional compensation in the nature of a penalty under this section, the claimant will
59	be deemed to have acknowledged that, owing to conditions over which the employer or carrier had no
60	control, such installment could not be paid within the period prescribed for payment and to have waived
 
1	the right to claim such penalty. However, during the course of a hearing, the judge of compensation
2	claims shall on her, or his own motion raise the question of whether such penalty should be awarded or
3	excused. The department may assess without a hearing the penalty against either the employer or the
4	carrier, depending upon who was at fault in causing the delay. The insurance policy cannot provide that
5	this sum will be paid by the carrier if the department or the judge of compensation claims determines that
6	the penalty should be paid by the employer rather than the carrier. Any additional installment of
7	compensation paid by the carrier pursuant to this section shall be paid directly to the employee by check
8	or, if authorized by the employee, by direct deposit into the employee’s account at a financial institution or
9	by transmission to the employee’s account with a money transmitter licensed under part II of chapter 560.

26	circumstances; requiring certain applicants to complete certain training;
27
28	Amending s. 489.511, F.S.; requiring the board to certify as qualified for certification by endorsement any
29	applicant who holds a specified license to practice electrical or alarm system contracting issued by
30	another state or territory of the United States under certain circumstances; requiring certain applicants to
31	complete certain training; amending s. 489.517, F.S.; providing a reduction in certain continuing
32	education hours required for certain contractors; amending s. 489.518, F.S.; requiring a person to have
33	completed a specified amount of training within a certain time period to perform the duties of an alarm
34	system agent;

43
44	(14) The department or a board must enter into a reciprocal licensing agreement with other states if the
45	practice act within the purview of this chapter permits such agreement. If a reciprocal licensing agreement
46	exists or if the department or board has determined another state’s licensing requirements or
47	examinations to be substantially equivalent or more stringent to those under the practice act, the
48	department or board must post on its website which jurisdictions have such reciprocal licensing
49	agreements or substantially similar licenses.

11	HB 401 – Florida Building Code
12
13	As it pertains to the administration of the Building Code, the bill:
14	•	Allows a substantially affected person to petition the Commission for a non-binding advisory opinion
15	on whether a local government regulation is an improper amendment to the Building Code, and
16	establishes a process for such petitions;
17	•	Allows the Commission to issue an “errata to the code” to list demonstrated errors in provisions
18	•	contained within the Building Code;
19	•	Requires the Commission to adopt rules for approving product evaluation entities in addition to the
20	ones already listed and approved in current law;
21	•	Clarifies that the Commission may suspend product evaluation entities;
22	•	Clarifies that local government entities may use private providers for their own construction projects;
23	•	Provides that a local government may use excess funds generated by Building Code enforcement for
24	the construction of a building or structure that houses the local government’s building department or
25	provides training programs for building officials, inspectors, or plans examiners;
26	•	Provides that excess funds used to construct such a building or structure must be designated for such
27	purpose by the local government and may not be carried forward for more than four years; and
28	•	Prohibits a local government from requiring a contract between a builder and an owner as a condition
29	to apply for or obtain a building permit.
30	•	Specifies that a local government may not use preliminary maps issued by the Federal Emergency
31	Management Agency for any law, ordinance, rule, or other measure that has the effect of imposing
32	land use changes or permits.
33	•	The bill makes several changes to current law pertaining to licensed individuals providing private
34	building inspection services, known as “private providers.” Current law allows contractors and
35	property owners to hire licensed building code administrators, engineers, and architects to review
36	building plans, perform building inspections, and prepare certificates of completion. The bill makes
37	the following changes to the private provider statute:
38	•	Expressly authorizes private providers to conduct virtual building inspections.
39	•	Allows private providers to submit various inspection forms, records, and reports electronically to local
40	building departments and utilize electronic signatures.
41	•	Allows private providers to conduct “single-trade inspections,” as defined in the bill.
42	•	Authorizes private providers to conduct emergency inspection services.
43	•	Additionally, the bill expressly authorizes local governments and school districts to use private
44	providers for public works projects and improvements to any building or structure.
45	•	Finally, the bill amends the Community Planning Act to prohibit local governments from adopting land
46	development regulations that regulate specific building design elements (such as exterior color and
47	cladding, ornamentation, styling of windows and doors, etc.) for single- and two-family dwellings.
48	However, certain exceptions are provided that allow local governments to regulate such building
49	design elements when: The dwelling is a historic property or located in a historic district, a community
50	redevelopment area, or a planned unit development or master planned community.
51
52	Except as otherwise expressly provided in this act, this act shall take effect July 1, 2021.

31	HB 667 - Building Inspections
32
33	Current law requires local governments to enforce the Building Code and issue building permits. Current

35	districts to enforce the Building Code in certain situations. It is unlawful for a person or corporation to
36	construct, alter, repair, or demolish a building without obtaining a permit from the enforcing agency.

38	the Building Code.
39
40	The bill authorizes any government entity with the authority to enforce the Building Code to perform virtual
41	building inspections, with the exception of certain structural inspections. The bill defines “virtual
42	inspection” as an inspection that uses visual or electronic aids to allow a building official or inspector to
43	perform an inspection without having to be physically present at the job site during the inspection.
44
45	The bill also requires local building code enforcement agencies to allow requests for inspections to be
46	submitted to the local agency electronically via e-mail, electronic form, or mobile application.
47
48	Finally, the bill requires a building code enforcement agency to refund 10 percent of the permit and
49	inspection fees if:
50
51	The inspector or building official determines the work, which requires the permit, fails an inspection; and
52	The inspector or building official fails to provide a reason that is based on compliance with the Building
53	Code, the Florida Fire Prevention Code, or local ordinance, indicating why the work failed the inspection
54	within 5 business days.

30	(6) A state or local enforcement agency may perform virtual inspections at the discretion of the
31	enforcement agency. However, a state or local enforcement agency may not perform virtual inspections
32	for structural inspections on a threshold building. For purposes of this subsection, the term "virtual
33	inspection" means a form of visual inspection which uses visual or electronic aids to allow a building code
34	administrator or an inspector, or team of inspectors, to perform an inspection without having to be
35	physically present at the job site during the inspection.
36
37
38	(7) (a) A local enforcement agency must refund 10 percent of the permit and inspection fees to a permit

28	CS/CS/HB 1059 – Construction Permits
29
30	CS/CS/HB 1059 makes various changes to the Florida Building Codes Act and related statutes. The
31	Florida Building Codes Act provides a mechanism for the uniform adoption, updating, interpretation, and
32	enforcement of a single, unified state building code. The Florida Building Code (Building Code) is the
33	statewide building code for all construction in the state and must be applied, administered, and enforced
34	uniformly and consistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
35
36	Local governments enforce the Building Code within their jurisdictions, primarily by conducting
37	inspections and issuing building permits to authorize construction. It is unlawful to construct, alter, repair,
38	or demolish a building without obtaining a building permit.
39
40	The bill makes various changes to the ways in which local enforcement agencies receive and process
41	building permit applications. Specifically, the bill requires local enforcement agencies to:
42	Allow building permit applications, including payments, attachments, drawings, and other documents, to
43	be submitted electronically.
44	Post the current status of every building permit application received on its website.
45	Post the agency’s procedures for reviewing, processing, and approving building permit applications on its
46	website.
47	Review additional information for an application for a development permit or development order within a
48	certain time-period.
49	Allow building permit applicants 10 business days to correct an application for a single-family residential
50	dwelling that was initially denied by the local enforcement agency.
51	Reduce permit fees by specified amounts after failing to meet statutory deadlines for reviewing certain
52	building permit applications.
53
54	Finally, the bill prohibits government entities, which enforce the Building Code, from requiring a copy of a
55	contractor’s contract with owners, subcontractors, or suppliers in order to obtain a building permit for
56	projects on commercial property.

29
30	(14) A building permit for a single-family residential dwelling must be issued within 30 business working
31	days after receiving the permit of application therefor unless unusual circumstances require a longer time
