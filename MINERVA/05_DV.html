14	PART 2 – LOCAL/STATE PRODUCT APPROVAL REVIEW PROCESS
15
16	The Overall Product Approval System
17
18	Product approval in Florida is a 3 three path process
19	Each path is defined by Florida Statute and/or contained in the Building Code Chapter 1
20	We will look at each step to view the options.
21
22	The Guiding Statute
23
24	Florida Statute 553 establishes the Florida Building Commission, guides the Florida Building Code, and
25	provides the overall guidance.
26
27	The areas that guide this process are:
28	553.841.
29	553.842.
30	Florida Building Code Chapter 1 – Administration.
31
32	The First Step
33
34	The Building Official has the authority to approve products that he/she feels meet the intent and
35	requirements of the Code .
36
37	[A]104.9 Approved materials and equipment.
38
39	Materials, equipment, and devices approved by the building official shall be constructed and installed in
40	accordance with such approval.
41
42	[A]104.9.1 Used materials and equipment.
43
44	The use of used materials that meet the requirements of this code for new materials is permitted. Used
45	equipment and devices shall not be reused unless approved by the building official.
46
47	The Building Official Approval
48
49	If the Building Official is comfortable with the information provided, the BO may approve the use.
50
51	If the Building Official is not familiar with the product, is not comfortable with the design or calculations,
52	then
53
54	The Building Official can go to Step 2 and/ or 3.
55
56
57	The Second Step
58
 
1	The Building Official can request information documenting the product, the design, test information or
2	other information related to the product.
3
4	This information may be a test report from a recognized test lab.
5
6	These reports are items such as a Miami Dade Notice of Acceptance (NOA), an ICC Evaluation Services
7	(ICC ES) report, a Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) report, or
8
9	A rational Analysis of a previous or similar report about the product and the specific installation from an
10	expert, such as a Professional Engineer.
11
12	Most Building Officials are not experts in every field.
13
14	Most Building Officials are not practicing engineers.
15
16	Documentation and verification of products and their performance is generally required.
17
18	This information is readily available from the various testing entities and manufacturers.
19
20	Let us look at the statutory wording.
21
22	553.8425 - Local Product Approval.
23
24	1) For local product approval, products or systems of construction shall demonstrate compliance with
25	the structural windload requirements of the Florida Building Code through one of the following
26	methods:
27
28	a) A certification mark, listing, or label from a commission-approved certification agency indicating
29	that the product complies with the code;
30
31	b) A test report from a commission-approved testing laboratory indicating that the product tested
32	complies with the code;
33
34	c) A product-evaluation report based upon testing, comparative or rational analysis, or a
35	combination thereof, from a commission-approved product evaluation entity which indicates that
36	the product evaluated complies with the code;
37
38	d) A product-evaluation report or certification based upon testing or comparative or rational analysis,
39	or a combination thereof, developed and signed and sealed by a Florida professional engineer or
40	Florida registered architect, which indicates that the product complies with the code;
41
42	e) A statewide product approval issued by the Florida Building Commission; or
43
44	f)	Designation of compliance with a prescriptive, material standard adopted by the commission by
45	rule under s. 553.842(15).
46
47	The Third Step
48
49	If Other Options Are Not Available - The third step is the Florida Product Approval System.
50
51	This was established to have a central clearing house of products that meet the Florida Building Code for
52	specific installations.
53
54	An Important Note!
55
56	No matter which system is used, just because a product has a test sheet or product approval number, the
57	use of that product must still meet the specific criteria of the installation.
58	This relates to design pressures, impact rating, fire resistance and attachment methods applicable to the
59	installation.
60
61	553.842 - Product evaluation and approval
 
1
2	1) The commission shall adopt rules under ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to develop and implement a
3	product evaluation and approval system that applies statewide to operate in coordination with the
4	Florida Building Code. The commission may enter into contracts to provide for administration of the
5	product evaluation and approval system. The commission’s rules and any applicable contract may
6	provide that the payment of fees related to approvals be made directly to the administrator. Any fee
7	paid by a product manufacturer shall be used only for funding the product evaluation and approval
8	system. The product evaluation and approval system shall provide:
9
10	a) Appropriate promotion of innovation and new technologies.
11
12	b) Processing submittals of products from manufacturers in a timely manner.
13
14	c) Independent, third-party qualified and accredited testing and laboratory facilities, product
15	evaluation entities, quality assurance agencies, certification agencies, and validation entities.
16
17	d) An easily accessible product acceptance list to entities subject to the Florida Building Code.
18
19	e) Development of stringent but reasonable testing criteria based upon existing consensus
20	standards, when available, for products.
21
22	f)	Long-term approvals, where feasible. State and local approvals will be valid until the
23	requirements of the code on which the approval is based change, the product changes in a
24	manner affecting its performance as required by the code, or the approval is revoked. However,
25	the commission may authorize by rule editorial revisions to approvals and charge a fee as
26	provided in this section.
27
28	g) Criteria for revocation of a product approval.
29
30	h) Cost-effectiveness.
31
32	Parenthesis 2 tells us that this system is designed to rely on national and international consensus
33	standards. This leads us back to the existing approval systems and to the published reports.
34
35	2) The product evaluation and approval system shall rely on national and international consensus
36	standards, whenever adopted by the Florida Building Code, for demonstrating compliance with
37	code standards. Other standards which meet or exceed established state requirements shall also
38	be considered.
39
40	The Commission Operation
41
42	In order to apply the law, the Commission established a rule for the application of the requirements .
43
44	An important note to be aware of is the Florida Product Approval System applies only to the envelope
45	and structural frame. No interior pieces or parts!

33
34	Florida Building Code 8th Edition (2023)
35
36	The Building Code is updated every 3 years. Product evaluations must be updated for continued
37	compliance.
38
39	There are three ways to have your product comply with the new code:
40	Self-Affirmation of existing application.
41	Revision of existing application.
42	New application.
43
44	Self–Affirmation FBC 2020
 
1
2	Application Self Affirmation
3
4	Upon review of the new Code, if the standards and restrictions in the new Code applicable to your
5	product have not changed, you can “self-affirm” that your product complies with applicable standards of
6	the new Code.
7
8	Please contact our offices before initiating a self-affirmation.
9
10	Self-Affirmations cost $100.
11
12	61G20-3.007 Product Approval by the Commission.
13
14	As part of application for self-affirmation, if the evaluation report refers to the previous edition of the Code,
15	the manufacturer of the approved product shall submit a statement from an approved evaluation or
16	validation entity that the product complies with the subsequent code version via an attachment uploaded
17	and submitted through the BCIS.
18
19	Application Revision FBC 2020.
20
21	If the standards or restrictions pertaining to your product in the 2020 Code have changed, then a product
22	revision application must be submitted.
23
24	New evidence such as a test report or an evaluation report demonstrating compliance must also be
25	submitted.
26
27	Revisions cost $500.
