7	TOPICS TO BE COVERED
8
9	•	Which version of the Energy volume applies?
10	•	Navigating the Energy Conservation volume
11	•	Commercial and Residential Construction Documents
12	•	Where are these other requirements and what are they for?
13	•	Finding the Code requirements
14	•	Existing Buildings
15
16	WHICH VERSION APPLIES?
17
18	The current Edition of the Florida Energy Conservation Volume part of the Florida Building Code 8t
19	Edition.
20
21	This volume took effect December 31, 2023.
22
23	Additional information is found in the Existing Buildings volume as well for things like “Repairs”.
24
25	Energy Through the Years
26
27	Florida Energy Code goes back to the 1970’s.
28	Many different methods have been employed over the years in attempts to gain efficiency.
29	Major changes have taken place over the last code change cycles.
30	The Florida Energy Conservation Volume is patterned after and based on the International Energy
31	Conservation Code (IECC).
32	There is a Commercial section and a Residential section.
33	The Florida Codes are updated every three years.
34	•	The next edition is scheduled to take effect December 31, 2026.
35
36	What it is trying to achieve
37
38	The goal of the Energy Conservation volume is to reduce overall energy and water usage.
39	Much talk has taken place about the building envelope, this was the original focus for energy.
40	Other systems are now included as we continue to strive for energy reductions.
41	Energy involves all trades and systems
 

1	The Need for Inspections and Documentation
2
3	As systems progress, some get simpler, and others become more complex. Training and education are
4	paramount to achieving the goals of energy reduction. Knowledge of the codes and understanding the
5	how and why is important to achieve efficiency.
6
7	When the designers, contractors, plan reviewers, inspectors, and owners work together, we can achieve
8	this lofty goal. Inspections help to ensure the requirements are being followed. Inspections are required
9	by Sections C104 and R104.
10
11	NAVIGATING THE ENERGY VOLUME
12
13	Introduction
14	Required Inspections
15	Commercial & Residential – Construction Documents
16
17	Introduction
18
19	Energy Conservation is broken into 2 sections:
20	•	Commercial
21	•	Residential
22	Each section has an Administration portion.
23	Each section has a complete Table of Contents and Index.
24	They are laid out similarly.

20
21	The code official shall examine or cause to be examined the accompanying construction documents and
22	shall ascertain whether the construction indicated and described is in accordance with the	requirements
23	of this code and other pertinent laws or ordinances. The code official is authorized to utilize a registered
24	design professional, or other approved entity not affiliated with the building design or construction, in
25	conducting the review of the plans and specifications for compliance with the code.
26
27	Florida does not have a required category of licensure for Energy Plan Review. The review falls onto ALL
28	plan reviewers to ensure the requirements are met. Perhaps more importantly, to review the overall
29	project to ensure the various parts and pieces are compatible and will function together based on each
30	reviewers knowledge of their portion of the project and to communicate that between trades.
31
32	Approval of Construction Documents
33
34	C103.3.1 Approval of construction documents
35
36	When the code official issues a permit where construction documents are required, the construction
37	documents shall be endorsed in writing and stamped “Reviewed for Code Compliance.” Such approved
38	construction documents shall not be changed, modified, or altered without authorization from the code
39	official. Work shall be done in accordance with the approved construction documents.
40
41	One set of construction documents so reviewed shall be retained by the code official. The other set shall
42	be returned to the applicant, kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the code official
43	or a duly authorized representative.
44
45	This is a Code requirement!
46
47	After the Permit is Issued
48
49	Once the permit is issued, the required inspections previously mentioned will be required. Section C
50	103.4 tells us that the plans must be followed.
51
52	C103.4 Amended construction documents.
53
54	Changes made during construction that are not in compliance with the approved construction documents
55	shall be resubmitted for approval as an amended set of construction documents.
56
57	This is to ensure the design is followed for efficiency.
58

26
27	R103.2.1 Building thermal envelope depiction –
28
29	The building’s thermal envelope shall be represented on the construction documents.
30
31	Review of Construction Documents
32
33	Same as Commercial
34
35	R103.3 Examination of documents
36
37	The code official shall examine or cause to be examined the accompanying construction documents and
38	shall ascertain whether the construction indicated and described is in accordance with the requirements
39	of this code and other pertinent laws or ordinances. The code official is authorized to utilize a registered
40	design professional, or other approved entity not affiliated with the building design or construction, in
41	conducting the review of the plans and specifications for compliance with the code.
42
43	Approval of Construction Documents
44
45	Same as Commercial
46
 

1	R103.3.1 Approval of construction documents.
2
3	When the code official issues a permit where construction documents are required, the construction
4	documents shall be endorsed in writing and stamped “Reviewed for Code Compliance.” Such approved
5	construction documents shall not be changed, modified, or altered without authorization from the code
6	official. Work shall be done in accordance with the approved construction documents.
7
8	One set of construction documents so reviewed shall be retained by the code official. The other set shall
9	be returned to the applicant, kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the code official or
10	a duly authorized representative.
11
12	This is a Code requirement!
13
14	WHERE ARE THESE OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT ARE THEY
15	FOR?
16
17	Finding Code Requirements
18
19	Finding the specific code requirements should not be difficult once you understand the layout
20
21	•	Start by determining if the project is Commercial or Residential
22	•	Next, determine if the design is prescriptive or performance
23	•	Remember, the mandatory sections apply either way!
24
25	For terms you are not familiar with, use the definitions found in Chapter 2.
26
27	It is good to review the terms contained here so you know if some of the common terminology may have
28	special meaning in this volume of the Code.
29
30	Attic is an example of this.
31	We ordinarily think of the attic as the space above the highest floor ceiling.
32	When applying the Energy Conservation volume, it is:
33	•	An enclosed unconditioned space located immediately below an uninsulated roof and
34	immediately above the ceiling of a building.
35
36	C101.2 Scope.
37
38	This code applies to commercial buildings and the buildings’ sites and associated systems and
39	equipment.
40
41	C101.4.1 Mixed occupancy
42
43	Where a building includes both residential and commercial occupancies, each occupancy shall be
44	separately considered and meet the applicable provisions of Florida Building Code, Energy
45	Conservation—Commercial Provisions or Florida Building Code, Energy Conservation—Residential
46	Provisions
47
48	R101.2 Scope
49
50	This code applies to residential buildings and the building sites and associated systems and equipment.
51
52	R 101.4.1 Mixed occupancy
53
54	Where a building includes both residential and commercial occupancies, each occupancy shall be
55	separately considered and meet the applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, Energy
56	Conservation—Commercial Provisions or Florida Building Code, Energy Conservation—Residential
57	Provisions.
 
1
2	Each portion applies to the Occupancy as defined in the Building Code volume that is applicable.
3
4	This means:
5
6	A condominium has commercial and residential portions.
7	The portions representing the group R, Residential units must comply with the Residential sections.
8	Hallways, common areas and all commercial areas must comply with the commercial portions of the
9	volume.
10	Put simply, if it is not Residential, the commercial sections apply.
11	Each section has a General Requirements part.
12	Each part has definitions specific to that part
13	Chapter 3 of each part covers General Requirements.
14	Chapter 4 of each part addresses Energy Efficiency.
15	Chapter 5 covers Existing Buildings.
16	Each section then contains the Referenced Standards, forms, and applicable appendixes.
17
18	As you utilize the Florida Energy Conservation volume, you will see it provides much information, both
19	required and optional paths for compliance.
20
21	The Prescriptive Path is similar to a recipe, where you follow the directions and install the items
22	required.
23
24	The Performance Path provides for versatility in design and application, usually modeled using computer
25	software.
26
27	Some items are still mandatory!
28
29	Commercial/Residential Chapter 3
30
31	Florida has 2 climate zones:
32
33	•	Zone 1A is the southernmost portion of the state.
34	•	Zone 2A is the remainder of the state.
35
36	All of Florida is designated as warm-humid locations. Chapter 3 also provides us with:
37
38	•	Insulation requirements.
39	•	Fenestration product ratings.
40	•	Maintenance requirement information.
41	•	Assembly calculation (Commercial).
42
43	Commercial Chapter 4
44
45	Chapter 4 starts with providing the design paths that may be used:
46
47	C401.2 Application.
48
49	Commercial buildings shall comply with one of the following:
50
51	•	1. The requirements of ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1, excluding section 9.4.1.1(g) of the standard.
52	•	2. The requirements of Sections C402 through C405. In addition, commercial buildings shall
53	comply with Section C406 and tenant spaces shall comply with Section C406.1.1.
54	•	3. The requirements of Sections C402.5, C403.2, C404, C405.2, C405.3, C405.5, C405.6 and
55	C407. The building energy cost shall be equal to or less than 85 percent of the standard
56	reference design building.
57
58	Option 1 refers to ASHRAE 90.1:
59
 
1	This is a standard in the industry.
2	Many of the requirements that are found in the text of the prescriptive requirements originate in this
3	document.
4	The book is published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air conditioning Engineers.
5	It is intended for all buildings except for low-rise residential.
6	It is considered the benchmark for energy efficiency.
7
8	Option 2 is the prescriptive path.

29
30	•	The “Renovated Building” dilemma
31	•	Repairing portions and systems
32	•	Is Engineering, Paperwork and Calculations Required?
33
34	The “Renovated Building” Dilemma
35
36	Florida Statute 553.902 provides a definition of “Renovated building” that has been incorporated into
37	Sections C101.4.2 and R101.4.2 as well as the definitions.
38
39	F.S. 553.902(6) “Renovated building” means a residential or nonresidential building undergoing
40	alteration that varies or changes insulation, HVAC systems, water heating systems, or exterior envelope
41	conditions, if the estimated cost of renovation exceeds 30 percent of the assessed value of the structure.
42
43	Essentially, if the alterations do not exceed 30% of the assessed value of the existing structure, the rules
44	of the Energy Conservation volume do not apply. Same for Both Residential and Commercial.
45
46	C/R 101.4.2 Exempt buildings.
47
48	Buildings exempt from the provisions of the Florida Building Code, Energy Conservation, include existing
49	buildings except those considered renovated buildings, changes of occupancy type or previously
50	unconditioned buildings to which comfort conditioning is added. Exempt buildings include those specified
51	in Sections C/R101.4.2.1 through C/R101.4.2.4.
52
53	This definition provides an exemption to the requirements of the Energy Conservation volume. The
54	statutory language was incorporated into Florida law in 1992. It has been a part of the Energy Code and
55	then the Energy Conservation volume ever since.
56
57
58	This basically allows existing buildings undergoing repairs and alterations to utilize the codes in effect at
 
1	the time of construction to be applied if the cost of the repairs or alterations do not exceed 30% of the
2	assessed value of the structure (not including the land).
3
4	Repairing Portions and Systems
5
6	Chapter 5 of the Energy Conservation volume covers Existing Buildings. This is true in both the
7	Commercial and Residential sections. Similar requirements exist in the beginning of each.
8
9	We will look at the Commercial sections and then the Residential.
10
11	C501.1 Scope.
12
13	The provisions of this chapter shall control the alteration, repair, addition and change of occupancy of
14	existing buildings and structures.
15
16	While this section seems to apply to all work on existing buildings, remember the exemption for buildings
17	that are not considered “renovated”.
18
19	C501.2 Existing buildings.
20
21	Except as specified in this chapter, this code shall not be used to require the removal, alteration, or
22	abandonment of, nor prevent the continued use and maintenance of, an existing building or building
23	system lawfully in existence at the time of adoption of this code.
24
25	This section clearly helps us to understand the intent is to allow the continuation of existing buildings and
26	we are not requiring existing buildings to replace everything in order to continue their use.
27
28	Again, this is further information reinforcing that existing buildings may continue in a safe condition based
29	on the code they were constructed to.
30
31	C501.3 Maintenance.
32
33	Buildings and structures, and parts thereof, shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. Devices
34	and systems that are required by this code shall be maintained in conformance to the code edition under
35	which installed. The owner or the owner’s authorized agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of
36	buildings and structures. The requirements of this chapter shall not provide the basis for removal or
37	abrogation of energy conservation, fire protection and safety systems and devices in existing structures.
38
39	C501.4 Compliance.
40
41	Alterations, repairs, additions, and changes of occupancy to, or relocation of, existing buildings and
42	structures shall comply with the provisions for alterations, repairs, additions and changes of occupancy or
43	relocation, respectively, in the Florida Building Code, Building; Florida Fire Prevention Code; Florida
44	Building Code, Fuel Gas; Florida Building Code, Mechanical; Florida Building Code, Plumbing; and NFPA
45	70.
46
47	C501.5 New and replacement materials.
48
49	Except as otherwise required or permitted by this code, materials permitted by the applicable code for
50	new construction shall be used. Like materials shall be permitted for repairs, provided hazards to life,
51	health or property are not created. Hazardous materials shall not be used where the code for new
52	construction would not permit use of these materials in buildings of similar occupancy, purpose, and
53	location.
54
 

1	C501.7 Building systems and components.
2
3	Thermal efficiency standards are set for the following building systems and components where new
4	products are installed or replaced in existing buildings, and for which a permit must be obtained. New
5	products shall meet the minimum efficiencies allowed by this code for the following systems and
6	components:
7
8	•	Heating, ventilating or air-conditioning systems.
9	•	Service water or pool heating systems.
10	•	Lighting systems; and
11	•	Replacement fenestration.
12
13	Exceptions:
14
15	•	1. Where part of a functional unit is repaired or replaced. For example, replacement of an entire
16	HVAC system is not required because a new compressor or other part does not meet code when
17	installed with an older system.
18	•	2. If the unit being replaced is itself a functional unit, such as a condenser, it does not constitute a
19	repair. Outdoor and indoor units that are not designed to be operated together must meet the
20	U.S. Department of Energy certification requirements contained in Section R303.1.2. Matched
21	systems are required; this match may be verified by any one of the following means:
22	o a) AHRI data
23	o b) Accredited laboratory
24	o c) Manufacturer’s letter
25	o d) Letter from registered P.E. State of Florida
26	•	3. Where existing components are utilized with a replacement system, such as air distribution
27	system ducts or electrical wiring for lights, such components or controls need not meet code if
28	meeting code would require that component’s replacement.
29	•	4. Replacement equipment that would require extensive revisions to other systems, equipment, or
30	elements of a building where such replacement is a like-for-like replacement, such as through-
31	the-wall condensing units and PTACs, chillers and cooling towers in confined spaces.
32
33	C501.7.1 Existing equipment efficiencies.
34
35	Existing cooling and heating equipment in residential applications need not meet the minimum equipment
36	efficiencies, including system sizing and duct sealing.
37
38	Why is this in the Commercial section when it specifically refers to applies to Residential?
39
40	Good Question! Does it mean Commercial applications need to comply as the Code changes?
41
42	No!
43
44	Let us look at Residential requirements.
45
46	R501.1.1 Additions, alterations, or repairs: General.
47
48	Additions, alterations, or repairs to an existing building, building system or portion thereof shall comply
49	with Section R502, R503 or R504. Unaltered portions of the existing building or building supply system
50	shall not be required to comply with this code.
51
52	R501.2 Existing buildings.
53
54	Except as specified in this chapter, this code shall not be used to require the removal, alteration, or
55	abandonment of, nor prevent the continued use and maintenance of, an existing building or building
56	system lawfully in existence at the time of adoption of this code.
57
 

1	R501.3 Maintenance.
2
