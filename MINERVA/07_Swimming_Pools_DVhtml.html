5	The Purpose of the Course, and Why You are Taking It
6
7	Your Safety
8	For the safety of your workers
9	For the safety of your customers
10	Because the law requires this education
11	Meet your CE requirement of 61G4-18.001 (2)(g)
12	Understanding this is now a requirement of the law and it is to protect them and more importantly the
13	public.
14
15	Section 1.03 – History
16
17	For many years there was a gray area of interpretation as to what a Licensed Pool Contractor could do
18	when performing maintenance on electrically powered pool equipment.
19
20	F.S. 489.105 (l) "Swimming pool/spa servicing contractor"
21
22	Means a contractor whose scope of work involves, but is not limited to, the repair and servicing of a
23	swimming pool, or hot tub or spa, whether public or private, or otherwise, regardless of use. The scope of
24	work includes the repair or replacement of existing equipment, any cleaning or equipment sanitizing that
25	requires at least a partial disassembling, excluding filter changes, and the installation of new pool/spa
26	equipment, interior refinishing, the reinstallation or addition of pool heaters, the repair or replacement of
27	all perimeter piping and filter piping, the repair of equipment rooms or housing for pool/spa equipment,
28	and the substantial or complete draining of a swimming pool, or hot tub or spa, for the purpose of repair
29	or renovation.
30
31	The problem is when the equipment to be installed, repaired, or replaced is connected and powered by
32	electric wires.
33
34	Who can disconnect/reconnect?
35
36	Is this within the scope of a Swimming Pool/Spa Contractor?
37
38	Is a Swimming Pool Contractor obligated to subcontract to an electrician?
39
40	The statute did not speak clearly to this.
41
42	What was allowed in one part of the state was not allowed in others based on interpretation of the same
43	statute.
44
45	Section 1.04 - The Empowering Legislation
46
47	The CILB has statutory authority to make changes to their rules.
48
49	F.S. 489.101 Purpose.
50
51	” The Legislature deems it necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to regulate
52	the construction industry.”
53
 
1	489.108 Rulemaking authority.
2
3	” The board has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement the
4	provisions of this chapter conferring duties upon it.”
5
6	After many months and many meetings and much discussion between all the “stakeholders” the following
7	2 rules were developed and adopted: 61G4-12.011(16) and 61G4-18.001.
8
9	Section 1.05 - 61G4-12.011 (16)
10
11	This is the definition and part of the rules created by the Board.
12	16) Installation or repair:
13
14	“Pursuant to section 489.105(3)(j)(k)(l), F.S., the term “installation or repair” of pool/spa equipment, as it
15	pertains to swimming pool and spa electrical work, is defined as inclusive of installation, replacement,
16	disconnection or reconnection of power wiring on the load side of the dedicated existing electrical
17	disconnecting means. If installation, removal, replacement, or upgrading of this circuit is necessary, the
18	work shall be performed by a licensed electrical contractor only. Nothing in this paragraph shall be
19	deemed to restrict or limit in any manner the scope of work authorized by law of other contractor
20	classifications, or other professions.”
21
22	Purpose of rule change
23
24	To clear up ambiguity in F.S. 489.105 regarding installation & repair of existing pool equipment.
25	To align the Pool Contractors stated scope of work with what was being practiced in the field.
26	To give guidance to local building departments as to what license is appropriate to issue a permit to when
27	involving the installation & repairs of electrically powered swimming pool equipment.
28	To allow pool contractors to legally disconnect and reconnect wiring to existing pool equipment for the
29	purpose of servicing without unnecessarily raising the cost to the public.
30
31	This new rule became law and effective on 5/24/2017.
32
33	On load side of dedicated existing disconnecting means:
34
35	On the equipment side of the electrical current supply line. Downstream from electric current shutoff or
36	disconnect.
37	Disconnect be dedicated:
38	Single pole electric switch.
39	Timeclock.
40	Cartridge fuse box disconnect.
41	Circuit breaker (only for shutoff purposes, not to be repaired or replaced!!).
42
43	Section 1.06 - 61G4-158.001
44
45	As part of the negotiations and rule making process it was agreed that if swimming pool contractors are to
46	be allowed to perform minor electric work on pool equipment, some continuing education on the basics of
47	electrical maintenance & safety procedures be required.
48
49	Rule 61G4-18.001 (CE) was opened as a companion rule and amended to require swimming pool
50	contractors to complete 1 hour of CE course time on swimming pool electric topics.
51
52	The 1 hour is INCLUDED as part of the normal required 14 hours of CE every 2 years and does not
53	increase the CE course time requirement.
54
55	This rule became law on July 19, 2017, and will be enforced beginning with the CE renewal cycle
56	ending 8/31/2018.
57
58	This is in the FAC which is the Boards Rule. The rules are made by the Board based on what they are
59	directed to do by the Legislature through the statutory language. It is also important to understand the
60	Board is empowered by FS 489 to protect the public. Based on recent events, these changes were
 
1	deemed necessary.
2
3	The new rule reads:
4
5	One (1) hour shall be required in the following topic:
6
7	(g) Pool electrical requirements if license is held in the following category: Commercial pool/spa,
8	Residential pool/spa, Swimming pool/spa servicing, or Residential pool/spa servicing specialty.
9
10	Section 1.07 - Current Issues and Reasons for Electrical CE
11
12	Electrical systems are not generally well understood.
13
14	Code compliance (inspections) relies on visual inspection - lack consistency.
15
16	Poor and/or incorrect installation or maintenance.
17
18	Environments are conducive to corrosion and damage.
19
20	Issues do not stop with owner acceptance of the initial installation of the product or the end of the
21	maintenance or service call.
22
23	If you are not a trained electrician, you may not understand what is important for safety. Permits are not
24	always required, so the oversight of another set of eyes from an inspector may not occur. Pool
25	environments are conducive to corrosion and other deleterious effects on systems and equipment. Visual
26	inspection and knowledge of what is required is critical for safety.

48
49	Section 2.02 - Electrical Information Objectives
50
51	Pool Definition: According to FBC, a pool must be 24” DEEP.
52	Splash pads or fountains are NOT pools. They have the same electrical requirements though!
53	Pool Not Permanent: This is a pool but NOT PERMANENT. It has different electrical requirements.
54	Kid Pools: Not a pool as there is no circulating system. It has no electrical requirements.
55
56	Section 2.03 - Corrosion & Electrical Systems
57
58	Swimming pool construction & maintenance should be concerned with each piece of equipment
 
1	connected to the pool.
2
3	A swimming pool facility is an interconnected system of heaters, filters, pumps, drains and so much more,
4	which means that a swimming Pool Contractor needs to stay on top of all these devices to ensure a clean
5	& safe swimming environment.
6
7	Running a pool day after day places a great amount of strain on the devices that keep the water clean
8	and swimmers safe, and every pool manager should know just how corrosion can affect their facilities.
9
10	“Corrosion is the culprit and inspection are the only way to prevent or at least
11	control it.”
12
13	Whether constructing a new swimming pool or providing maintenance and repair of equipment, it is
14	important to choose the right materials to ensure adequate corrosion-resistance. In swimming pool
15	operations, equipment is under constant exposure to moistures and various pool chemicals, which are
16	highly corrosive.
17
18	Due to the corrosive properties of Chlorine, Muriatic Acid, salts and the weather itself the electrical
19	components of a pool are under constant attack. These system and components should be inspected
20	upon every visit whether for routine maintenance & servicing or repairing a specific part.
21
22	“Corrosion can take many forms, and correct selection of materials and finishes
23	is key to preventing each type. Follow these three steps when installing or
24	replacing electrical components: “
25
26	Select materials according to their galvanic properties. Different metals and alloys have different
27	electrode potentials. When two different metals are electrically connected in the presence of an
28	electrolyte, such as seawater, the more active metal will become anodic – losing electrons and increasing
29	its oxidation state in a process known as galvanic corrosion. Galvanic corrosion can be minimized by
30	selecting metals close together in the galvanic series.
31
32	Use protective coatings. Various finishes can be applied to help isolate metallic surfaces from the
33	surrounding corrosive environment. The most familiar example is ordinary paint applied to steel to prevent
34	rust, but there are many other methods including baked enamel, epoxy powder coat, and PVC coating.
35
36	Choose nonmetallic components. Manufacturers are increasingly offering nonmetallic products that are
37	completely impervious to the environments and substances that can corrode metals.
38
39	Section 2.04 - Impedance & Corrosion
40
41	What is impedance?
42
43	Think of the word: IMPEDE which means “to hinder”. Simply put, impedance is a number measuring the
44	resistance an electric circuit or wire to the flow of an AC electrical current.
45
46	When impedance becomes too great for a given flow of AC electrical current the result is excessive heat
47	being built up in the wire or circuit. If this heat becomes too great there is an increasing chance of fire
48	being created.
49
50	Impedance and required AC current for an electrically powered pool component is the reason why certain
51	gauge wires are specified for the connect to and from electrical components.
52
53	The fact is that corrosion will many time increase the impedance of a wire or the connections of wires to
54	the components.
55	All electrical connection to pool equipment should be checked on a regular basis. If corrosion is setting
56	in, sometimes a simple cleaning and reconnecting is all that is needed. In more severe instances, the wire
57	or connection must be replaced.
58
59	A licensed pool professional should always perform a safety inspection of the electrically powered
 
1	components of the pool for safety issues much as a car mechanic will perform a safety inspection when a
2	car is in for an oil change.
3
4	Section 2.05 - Grounding vs. Bonding
5
6	What does “Grounding” mean?
7
8	The National Electrical Code (NFPA 70) defines the word “Ground” as the earth.
9	We think of something being grounded as having a safety wire, the green conductor. It is never used
10	during normal operation; it only comes into play during a ground fault.
11	This conductor is used only in case of a ground fault and is intended only to carry current long enough to
12	clear an overcurrent device. The bonding conductor is always carrying voltage and/or current.
13
14	Ground to the earth.
15
16	Ground Fault: An unintentional, electrically conducting connection between an ungrounded conductor of
17	an electrical circuit and the normally non–current-carrying conductors, metallic enclosures, metallic
18	raceways, metallic equipment, or earth.
19	Grounded (Grounding): Connected (connecting) to ground or to a conductive body that extends the
20	ground connection.
21	Grounded, Solidly: Connected to ground without inserting any resistor or impedance device.
22	Grounded Conductor: A system or circuit conductor that is intentionally grounded.
23
24	A ground fault is not a short circuit!
25
26	A short circuit is when the wires intended to be part of the circuit touch each other, and generally go
27	boom!!
28	A ground fault is when electricity goes through an unintended path, such as the case of the motor, or
29	you. The ground wire is used to carry to carry this current, referred to as fault or overcurrent, we hope, in
30	order to open the fuse or circuit breaker ahead of the circuit This is referred to as clearing the fault or
31	opening the overcurrent device.
32	A bond wire is always carrying voltage and current because it is making sure there is no difference of
33	potential between the connected items. That is why it is bigger, and it will protect you, if you, and your
34	customer, make sure it is in place, the right size and properly connected.
35
36	Section 2.06 - Why Do We Ground Items?
37
38	This is a ground fault. It is important you understand these concepts and theories. The topics below,
39	show what they are, and how a ground fault is being created, not a short circuit.
40	To clear ground faults.
41	Grounding is not related to a short circuit.
42	A ground fault is an unintended path.
43	A GFCI would protect this individual!
44	A breaker or fuse will not!
45
 
1
2	Section 2.07 - Why Do We Bond Items?
3
4	Bonding is one of the most important items around pools. All the metal around the electrical service
5	is bonded to the neutral for protection and ensures stability of the voltage once attached to earth. All
6	metal piping systems including water, metal ducts, building steel and numerous other items, are bonded
7	to prevent arcing, sparking, and limit shock hazards. Tying everything together prevents voltages
8	traveling between the various services, protecting the users of the systems.
9
10	It eliminates voltage gradients.
11	Very simply, for safety!
12	It eliminates voltage differences.
13	It is required by the governing Codes.
14	It prevents shock hazards from developing.
15
16	Bonding the Pump Motor
17
18	If not done, this is a blatant violation and life safety hazard!
19	It must be installed initially by electrician.
20	Pool contractors must inspect, maintain, and repair if necessary.
21	Critical to proper safety.
22	Pool contractors must check for integrity during every visit.
23
24	The importance of bonding and grounding in swimming pools, equipment, deck
25	and adjacent structures and cannot be overstated.
26
27	The grounded circuits of electrically powered pumps and equipment need to
28	have an effective return path from the equipment to the power source in
29	order to function properly.
30
31	In addition, non-current-carrying metallic components in a swimming pool
32	facility, such as structural steel, ladders, slides, diving boards and screen
33	enclosures need to be electrically interconnected so voltage potential cannot
34	exist between them.
35
36	Section 2.08 - The Mysterious GFCI
37
38	A GFCI is a simple device. It stands for Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter and will
39	not clear a short circuit.
40
41	It monitors the hot and neutral for any imbalance in current. The imbalance can be on the hot or neutral.
42
43	Often consumers do not understand them, and they also think it has an effect when someone is caught
44	between the hot and neutral. A GFCI ONLY detects ground faults and that needs to be stressed. A
45	ground fault is when EITHER the hot or neutral current is diverted from the circuit conductors through an
46	alternate path.
47
48	If for example, a person contacts the hot or neutral wire and conducts a flow of electricity to earth, the
49	current transformer shown in the diagram (shown on the next slide) senses a difference of electrical flow
50	between the hot and neutral. When this flow exceeds the 5-mA threshold, the device “trips” and
51	disconnects the hot and neutral conductor from the circuit to protect the person.
52
53	Notice in the diagram, the test button simulates the same type of scenario previously mentioned and
54	should be tested once a month, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
55

2
3	GFCI vs. AFCI
4
5	Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCI) help prevent burns, electric shocks, and electrocution. A
6	GFCI has sensors that measure the current going out and the current coming back in. Normally, the
7	current is balanced as it goes out and comes back in.
8	However, if the current is out of balance, something is wrong. The electric current has contacted a
9	human, or somewhere else it should not be.
10
11	The GFCI senses this and instantly shuts down the circuit, stopping the flow of electricity. Since water is
12	an excellent electric conductor, GFCIs are important in areas where water and electricity could meet,
13	such as bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms and garages.
14
15	GFCI vs. AFCI
16
17	Arc Fault Circuit Interrupters (AFCI) help prevent electric fires. An AFCI should never be installed in
18	place of or as a substitute for a GFCI.
19
20	Electricity can leak out of damaged or decaying wires and start a fire. These fires spread quickly in the
21	wiring behind walls. Electric fires cause more damage than other types of fire and are twice as deadly.
22	AFCIs sense that electricity is leaking from the electric system and shut electricity off before overheating
23	happens.
24
25	Basically, GFCIs prevent shocks, and AFCIs prevent fires. By law BOTH MUST be installed by a
26	qualified electrician.
27
28	Section 2.09 - Relevant Codes, Standards, & Definitions
29
30	Relevant Standards: NEC – Article 680
31
32	This is the section of the electrical code that requires the bonding of metal items. This applies to motors,
33	lights, both in and out of the pool, metal windows, metal doors, screen enclosures and basically anything
34	metal that is in, on or around the pool that could possibly become energized. Yes, even the copper
35	shower located on the pool deck if it is within 5 feet.

10	“A ‘Swimming Pool Private’ means any structure, located in a residential area, that is intended for
11	swimming or recreational bathing and contains water over 24 inches deep, including, but not limited to,
12	in-ground, above-ground, and on-ground swimming pools; hot tubs; and non-portable spas.”
13
14	Earlier we discussed what a pool might be. The Florida Building Code has one definition, and the National
15	Electrical Code has a different definition.
16
17	This is problematic if you do not understand why. The Building Code has specific concerns for safety as
18	does the electrical code. Electrically, we need to be incredibly careful around bodies of water that contain
19	minerals, dissolved solids and other chemicals.
20
21	The electrical code rules when those regulations apply, and the building code governs when
22	those definitions apply.
23
24	A “public swimming pool” or “public pool” means a single watertight structure of concrete, masonry
25	or other approved materials that is located either indoors or outdoors, used for bathing or swimming by
26	humans, and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, together with buildings, appurtenances
27	and equipment used in connection therewith. A public swimming pool or public pool shall mean a
28	conventional pool, spa-type pool, wading pool, special purpose pool, interactive water feature or water
29	recreation attraction, to which admission may be gained with or without payment of a fee and includes,
30	but is not limited to, pools operated by or serving camps, churches, cities, counties, day care centers,
31	group home facilities for eight or more clients, health spas, institutions, parks, state agencies, schools,
32	subdivisions, or the cooperative living-type projects of five or more living units, such as apartments,
33	boardinghouses, hotels, mobile home parks, motels, recreational vehicle parks, and townhouses. The
34	term does not include a swimming pool located on the grounds of a private residence.
35
36	The Definition of a Pool
37
38	SWIMMING POOL. Any structure, basin, chamber, or tank containing an artificial body of water for
39	swimming, diving or recreational bathing located in a residential area serving four or fewer living units
40	having a depth of 2 feet (610 mm) or more at any point as defined in Section 515.25, Florida Statutes, or
41	the body of water is a public pool as defined in Section 514.011, Florida Statutes.

14	Section 3.02 - Is a Permit Required?
15
16	Florida Building Code – Building - Section 105.1 Permit Required.
17
18	The code goes on to say that with the permission of the building official, minor repairs not impacting
19	safety may be done without a permit.
20
21	Some areas have a published list of what is allowed to be done without permits. In other areas, you need
22	to contact the building department to find out if a permit is required.
23
24	Regardless of whether a permit is required or not, code compliance is required by section 102.2 of

33
34	Code requirements are based solely on safety. Manufacturer’s instructions must also be followed. Pumps
35	REQUIRE a minimum #12 equipment ground wire. Most pumps also require connection to the bonding
36	grid by a #8 solid copper conductor. The connection of these 2 conductors is a life safety requirement.
37	While the GFCI would seem to be sufficient for the safety of the overall system, this is the belt and
38	suspenders approach to assuring safety and proper operation.
39
40	GFCI Receptacle
41
42	The GFCI may be a receptacle, a circuit breaker, or even a GFCI protector. If
43	any portions of the protective systems are found to be missing or non-
44	operational, they should be noted and be sure to tell the owner. Never by-
45	pass or remove it.
46
47	If these items affect the life safety portion of the overall system, such as a
48	missing bond wire or GFCI that does not test properly, DO NOT TURN ON
49	THE SYSTEM and advise the owner that an electrician is required before
50	energizing. Always make sure the pump is grounded and bonded.
51
52	Be aware: the energy code may require a 2-speed motor.
53
 

1	Section 3.04 - Applicable NEC Sections
2
3	Be aware of and know how to find and reference each of these NEC sections:
4
5	680.6 Grounding
6	680.11 Equipment Rooms and Pits
7	680.12 Maintenance Disconnecting Means
8	680.21 Motors Requirements
9
10	1) General: The branch circuits for pool-associated motors shall be installed in rigid metal conduit,
11	intermediate metal conduit, rigid polyvinyl chloride conduit, reinforced thermosetting resin conduit, or
12	Type MC cable listed for the location. Other wiring methods and materials shall be permitted in specific
13	locations or applications as covered in this section. Any wiring method employed shall contain an
14	insulated copper equipment grounding conductor sized in accordance with 250.122 but not smaller than
15	12 AWG.
16
17	680.21 Motor Requirements
18
19	No matter the wiring method, the electrical code does not want to rely on the wiring method for the ground
20	fault return path. The required #12 insulated copper conductor, run with the circuit conductors, ensures a
21	low impedance path to clear any ground faults and, will hopefully be a lower resistance than any person
22	or other connection that may interfere with clearing the fault. Clearing the fault, means tripping the circuit
23	breaker or blowing the fuse.
24
25	The other code section referred to here, 250.122, is a table in the electrical code that provides the size of
26	the required equipment grounding conductor based on the size of the fuse or circuit breaker.
27
28	Section 3.04 - Applicable NEC Sections
29
30	680.21 Motor Requirements
31
32	A representation of wire sizes. There will be writing on the insulation indicating the size. Verify it!
33









34
35
36	On or Within Buildings: Where installed on or within buildings, electrical metallic tubing shall be
37	permitted.
38	Flexible Connections: Where necessary to employ flexible connections at or adjacent to the motor,
39	liquid tight flexible metal or liquid tight flexible nonmetallic conduit with approved fittings shall be
40	permitted.
41
42	It is often necessary to provide a flexible connection for the electric supply going to the motor. This
43	prevents the transmission of vibrations and helps ensure the ongoing integrity of the electrical connection.
44	Whatever acceptable wiring method is used, remember to be sure to use the proper fittings. Fittings for
45	these wiring methods are listed for specific types, such as metallic or non-metallic and type A or type B.
46
 

1	Section 3.05 – Insulation

3	Metallic Flexible Conduit
4
5	The most common flexible wiring methods – Metallic Flexible Conduit (Sealtite for outside, Greenfield for
6	inside), and Non-Metallic Flexible Conduit, probably the best option.
7	Each one requires fitting listed to be used with that wiring method.

9
10
11	Double Insulated Motor Bonding Requirement
12
13	Double insulated means the pump has an extra layer of protection and all the electrical parts are located
14	within a non-conductive housing. This means you can’t touch any of the electrical parts. The symbol will
15	be found on the nameplate.
16
17	A listed cord-and-plug connected pool pump incorporating an approved system
18	of double insulation that provides a means for grounding only the internal and
19	non-accessible, non–current-carrying metal parts of the pump shall be
20	connected to any wiring method recognized in Chapter 3 that is suitable for the
21	location. Where the bonding grid is connected to the equipment grounding
22	conductor of the motor circuit in accordance with the second sentence of
23	680.26(B)(6)(a), the branch-circuit wiring shall comply with 680.21(A).
24
25	A bonding wire does not have to be connected to the motor itself if the motor is
26	double insulated and the cord and plug to the motor is grounded properly.
27
28	New In The Current Code
29
30	(C) GFCI Protection. Outlets supplying pool pump motors connected to single-phase, 120 volt through
31	240-volt branch circuits, rated 15 or 20 amperes, whether by receptacle or by direct connection, shall be
32	provided with ground-fault circuit interrupter protection for personnel.
33
34	Section 3.06 – Lighting
35
36	Be aware of and know how to find and reference each of these
37	sections:
38
39	680.22: Lighting, Receptacles, and Equipment
40
41	(B): Luminaires, Lighting Outlets, and Ceiling-Suspended (Paddle)Fans
42
43	680.23: Underwater Luminaires
44
45	Lighting in and around pools has always been popular. The hazard for lighting in
46	and around pools has always been a concern. In some cases, especially indoors, we may also have
47	ceiling lights and/or ceiling fans. We need to be sure if these are close to the pool, they are bonded and
48	protected by GFCI. There are locations that are prohibited from having these items. In any case, they
49	need to be listed for the use and location.
50
 

1	Wet-Niche Luminaire
2
3	A wet niche is currently the most common type of fixture and requires a bond
4	in the niche that attached to the bonding grid. As we move more and more to
5	LED, the next types of fixtures will reduce electrical consumption and the way
6	they are installed.
7
8	Understand the difference! Even if a wet niche is changed to an LED, the
9	bonding of the niche is required.
10
11	Dry-Niche Luminaire
12
13	Dry niche luminaires are dry and gasketed, they do not contact pool water.
14
15	No-Niche Luminaire
16
17	This style penetrates the entire shell with a waterproof housing. All service is done from the rear or
18	requires the pool to be drained for service!
19
20	Through-Wall Lighting Assembly
21
22	For through wall installations, a professionally installed pool transformer is still required.
23
24	Remember That Bonding Discussion?
25
26	NEC 680.23(5) Luminaire Bonding: The luminaire shall be bonded to, and secured to, the forming shell
27	by a positive locking device that ensures a low resistance contact and requires a tool to remove the
28	luminaire from the forming shell. Bonding shall not be required for luminaires that are listed for the
29	application and have not non–current-carrying metal parts.
30
31	Note the wording here. We are counting on this connection to be sure the ring is bonded and grounded.
32	This may also serve as our water bond for the pool water. We need to ensure a low impedance
33	connection - no tie wraps!
34
35	Section 3.07 - Wiring Methods
36
37	NEC 680.22 Lighting, Receptacles, and Equipment
38
39	(A) Receptacles.
40
41	1. Required Receptacle, Location. Where a permanently installed pool is installed at a dwelling unit(s),
42	no fewer than one 125-volt, 15-or 20-ampere receptacle on a general-purpose branch circuit shall be
43	located not less than 1.83 m (6 ft.) from, and not more than 6.0 m (20 ft.) from, the inside wall of the pool.
44	This receptacle shall be located not more than 2.0 m (6 ft. 6 in.) above the floor, platform, or grade level
45	serving the pool.
46
47	2. Circulation and Sanitation System, Location. Receptacles that provide power for water-pump
48	motors or for other loads directly related to the circulation and sanitation system shall be located at least
49	3.0 m (10 ft.) from the inside walls of the pool, or not less than 1.83 m (6 ft.) from the inside walls of the
50	pool if they meet all of the following conditions:
51	Consist of single receptacles.
52
53	•	Employ a locking configuration.
54	•	Are of the grounding type.
55	•	Have GFCI protection.
56
57
58	The general rule is to hard wire the pump. If the pump is connected by way of a receptacle and cord cap,
 
1	it must meet these requirements.
2
3	3. Other Receptacles, Location. Other receptacles shall be not less than 1.83 m (6 ft.) from the inside
4	walls of a pool.
5
6	Where a pool is installed at a dwelling unit, not fewer than one receptacle shall be located not less than
7	6ft. and not more than 20 ft. from the inside wall of the pool. This outlet must not be more than 6ft. 6
8	inches above the floor, platform or grade level serving the pool.
9
10	4. GFCI Protection. All 15- and 20-amp, single phase, 125-volt receptacles located within 6.0 m (20 ft.) of
11	the inside walls of the pool shall be protected by a ground-fault circuit interrupter.
12
13	5. Measurements. In determining the dimensions in this section addressing receptacle spacings, the
14	distance to be measured shall be the shortest path the supply cord of an appliance connected to the
15	receptacle would follow without piercing a floor, wall, ceiling, doorway with hinged or sliding door, window
16	opening, or another effective permanent barrier.
