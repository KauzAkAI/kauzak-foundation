Chapter 8
KNOW YOUR BUILDING CODE!
EIGHTH EDITION (2023)
1	FBC-BUILDING
2
3
4	The Florida building codes that will be reviewed in this chapter are:
5
6	•	Building
7	•	Residential
8	•	Existing Building
9	•	Plumbing
10	•	Mechanical
11
12	FLORIDA BUILDING CODE
13
14	The next section provides information on some of the key components of the FBC.
15
16	CHAPTER 1 SCOPE AND ADMINISTRATION
17
18	Chapter 1 is divided into two sections. Part I is Scope and Application; Part II is Administration and
19	Enforcement.
20
21	Part I – Scope and Application
22
23	101.3 Intent
24
25	The purpose of this code is to establish the minimum requirements to provide a reasonable level of
26	safety, public health, and general welfare through structural strength, means of egress in facilities,
27	stability, sanitation, adequate light and ventilation, energy conservation, and safety to life and property
28	from fire and other hazards attributed to the built environment and to provide a reasonable level of safety
29	to fire fighters and emergency responders during emergency operations.
30
31	In general, the purpose of the building code is to provide public safety and safety of the emergency
32	officers in case of fire or any other catastrophic situations. The building code is the minimum standard of
33	construction. The safety of the building is to give any one trapped or rescuers 60 minutes to get out of the
34	building.
35
36	Reasonable degree of safety to public in the built environment:
37	•	Code is for minimum requirements
38
39	Structurally sound buildings provide:
40	Life safety to public
41
42	Fire resistant construction provides:
43	•	Life safety to public
44	•	Life safety to firefighters
45	•	Property protection for building and exposures
46
47	Egress provisions:
 

1	•	Clearly defined exits routes that are accessible to evacuate the building quickly and safely in case
2	of a fire
3
4	These codes are available online for you to view at floridabuilding.org
5
6	This is especially important as this is the part that many contractors get in trouble with. So, let’s review
7	few of these.
8
9	102.1 General
10
11	Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
12	requirement shall be applicable. Where, in any specific case, different sections of this code specify
13	different materials, methods of construction, or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.
14
15	Part II Administration and Enforcement
16
17	105.2 Work Exempt from Permit
18
19	Exemptions from permit requirements of this code shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any work
20	to be done in any manner in violation of the provisions of this code. Permits shall not be required for the
21	following:
22
23	Gas
24	•	Portable heating appliance
25	•	Replacement of any minor part that does not alter approval of equipment or make such
26	equipment unsafe
27
28	Mechanical
29	•	Portable heating appliance
30	•	Portable ventilation equipment
31	•	Portable cooling unit
32	•	Steam, hot or chilled water piping within any heating or cooling equipment regulated by this code

37	•	The installation, replacement, removal, or metering of any load management control device
38
39	Plumbing
40	•	The stopping of leaks in drains, water, soil, waste, or vent pipe, provided, however, that if any
41	concealed trap, drainpipe, water, soil, waste or vent pipe becomes defective and it becomes
42	necessary to remove and replace the same with new material, such work shall be considered as
43	new work and a permit shall be obtained and inspection made as provided in this code.
44	•	The clearing of stoppages or the repairing of leaks in pipes, valves or fixtures and the removal
45	and reinstallation of water closets, provided such repairs do not involve or require the
46	replacement or rearrangement of valves, pipes, or fixtures.
47
48	[A] 105.2.1 Emergency Repairs
49
50	Where equipment replacements and repairs must be performed in an emergency situation, the permit
51	application shall be submitted within the next working business day to the building official.
52
53	[A] 105.2.2 Minor Repairs
54
55	Ordinary minor repairs may be made with the approval of the building official without a permit, provided
56	the repairs do not include the cutting away of any wall, partition or portion thereof, the removal or cutting
57	of any structural beam or load-bearing support, or the removal or change of any required means of
58	egress, or rearrangement of parts of a structure affecting the egress requirements; nor shall ordinary
 
1	repairs include addition to, alteration of, replacement or relocation of any standpipe, water supply, sewer,
2	drainage, drain leader, gas, soil, waste, vent or similar piping, electric wiring systems or mechanical
3	equipment or other work affecting public health or general safety, and such repairs shall not violate any of
4	the provisions of the technical codes.
5
6	105.4.1 Permit Intent
7
8	A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate,
9	cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit
10	prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or
11	violations of this code. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such
12	permit is commenced within 6 months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is
13	suspended or abandoned for a period of 6 months after the time the work is commenced.
14
15	105.4.1.1
16
17	If work has commenced and the permit is revoked, becomes null and void, or expires because of lack of
18	progress or abandonment, a new permit covering the proposed construction shall be obtained before
19	proceeding with the work.
20
21	105.4.1.2
22
23	If a new permit is not obtained within 180 days from the date the initial permit became null and void, the
24	building official is authorized to require that any work which has been commenced or completed be
25	removed from the building site. Alternately, a new permit may be issued on application, providing the
26	work in place, and required to complete the structure meets all applicable regulations in effect at the time
27	the initial permit became null and void and any regulations which may have become effective between the
28	date of expiration and the date of issuance of the new permit.
29
30	105.4.1.3
31
32	Work shall be considered to be in active progress when the permit has received an approved inspection
33	within 180 days. This provision shall not be applicable in case of civil commotion or strike or when the
34	building work is halted due directly to judicial injunction, order, or similar process.
35
36	105.4.1.4
37
38	The fee for renewal reissuance and extension of a permit is set forth by the administrative authority.
