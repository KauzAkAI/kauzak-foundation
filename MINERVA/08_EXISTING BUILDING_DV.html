Chapter 8
1	KNOW YOUR BUILDING CODE!
2	EIGHTH EDITION (2023)
3	FBC-EXISTING BUILDING
4
5
6	INTRODUCTION
7
8	Existing Building Definition
9
10	When is a building considered “existing”? The FBC-Existing Building volume provides guidance with the
11	following definition:
12
13	Chapter 2, Section 202 General Definitions
14
15	[A] Existing Building. A building erected prior to the date of adoption of the appropriate code, or one for
16	which a legal building permit has been issued.
17
18	There are some stipulations to the interpretation of this rule. Just because a building exists does not
19	make it legal. Just because a building exists does make it occupiable. Just because a building exists does
20	not mean it is being used as intended.
21
22	Rules governing occupancy can be found in Chapter 1, Sections 101.4.1, .2, and 101.7 outlined later in
23	this chapter.
24
25	CHAPTER 1 SCOPE AND ADMINISTRATION
26
27	101 General
28
29	101.1 Title
30
31	These regulations shall be known as the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, hereinafter referred to
32	as “this code.” In addition to the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of Chapter 1, Florida Building
33	Code, Building, shall govern the administration and enforcement of this code.
34
35	101.2 Scope
36
37	The provisions of this code shall apply to the construction, alteration, movement, enlargement,
38	replacement, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, location, maintenance, removal, and demolition of
39	every building or structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or structures.
40
41	Exceptions:
42
43	Detached one- and two-family dwellings and multiple single-family dwellings (town houses) not more than
44	three stories above grade plane in height with a separate means of egress and their accessory structures
45	shall comply with the Florida Building Code, Residential.
46	Existing buildings undergoing repair, alterations or additions and change of occupancy shall be permitted
47	to comply with the Florida Building Code, Existing Building.
48
 
1	101.2.1 Appendices
2
3	Provisions in the appendices shall not apply unless specifically adopted. [FBC-Building]
4
5	[A] 101.4 Applicability
6
7	This code shall apply to the repair, alteration, change of occupancy, addition, and relocation of existing
8	buildings, regardless of occupancy, subject to the criteria of Sections 101.4.1 and 101.4.2.
9
10	[A] 101.4.1 Buildings Not Previously Occupied
11
12	A building or portion of a building that has not been previously occupied or used for its intended purpose
13	in accordance with the laws in existence at the time of its completion shall be permitted to comply with the
14	provisions of the laws in existence at the time of its original permit unless such permit has expired.
15	Subsequent permits shall comply with the Florida Building Code, Building or Florida Building Code,
16	Residential, as applicable, for new construction.
17
18	Commentary: This section makes it clear that a building under construction when the code changes is
19	permitted to continue under construction based on the approved plans and permits. Changes to the new
20	code do not affect this construction as it is underway. A building that was not completed and has allowed
21	the permit to expire is different.
22
23	If the building was not completed, the permit expired, and the building never received a Certificate of
24	Occupancy, meaning it has not been used for the intended purpose, a new permit in compliance with the
25	code in effect at the time of application is required, This section further makes it clear that a building not
26	used for the intended purpose is also considered NOT previously occupied. This could be a building
27	constructed as a mercantile, Group M, and then used for assembly purposes, Group A, as an example. It
28	was not designed or constructed for that use.
29
30	[A] 101.4.2 Buildings Previously Occupied
31
32	The legal occupancy of any building existing on the date of adoption of this code shall be permitted to
33	continue without change, except as is specifically covered in this code, the Florida Fire Prevention Code,
34	or as is deemed necessary by the code official for the general safety and welfare of the occupants and
35	the public.
36
37	Commentary: Buildings that are in use and being used as intended are permitted to continue in that use.
38	This is the reason for the Existing Building volume. Just because the code has been updated, we do not
39	go through communities and require that each building be reconstructed. This is not only unfair; it is
40	unreasonable and costly.
41
42	[A] 101.5 Safeguards During Construction
43
44	Construction work covered in this code, including any related demolition, shall comply with the
45	requirements of Chapter 15.
46
47	[A] 101.6 Appendices
48
49	Reserved.
50
51	[A] 101.7 Correction of Violations of Other Codes
52
53	Repairs or alterations mandated by any property, housing, or fire safety maintenance code or mandated
54	by any licensing rule or ordinance adopted pursuant to law shall conform only to the requirements of that
55	code, rule, or ordinance and shall not be required to conform to this code unless the code requiring such
56	repair or alteration so provides.
57
58
59	Commentary: This and 101.4.2 that allows buildings to continue in use make several things clear. We do
60	not intend to apply the current edition of the code to existing buildings. A building being used as intended
 
1	can continue to operate in the capacity for which it was originally designed, this is true even if the current
2	edition of the code would require something different, such as the addition of fire sprinklers. If there are
3	items found in other codes, rules, or laws they are not required by this volume and are not to be applied
4	as if they were. Existing violations of life safety that may be present and discovered during alterations are
5	to be cited to the owner.
6
7	Often during an alteration or repair, existing violations of the codes are uncovered. Some of these may be
8	accidental or inadvertent. Some may have been caused by previous owners or tenants. The contractor
9	making the repairs or alterations may have been unaware of any issues. It may be outside of their
10	contract. Unless there is a life safety issue, those items found must be cited independently of any work
11	being performed.
12
13	101.8 Existing Mechanical Equipment
14
15	An agency or local government may not require that existing mechanical equipment located on or above
16	the surface of a roof be installed in compliance with the requirements of the Florida Building Code except
17	during reroofing when the equipment is being replaced or moved and is not in compliance with the
18	provisions of the Florida Building Code relating to roof-mounted mechanical units.
19
20	CHAPTER 5 6 CLASSIFICATION OF WORK
21
22	Alterations
23
24	An alteration can be defined as, any construction or renovation to an existing structure other than repair
25	or addition. Alterations are broken down into three categories, Levels 1, 2, and 3.
26
27	When doing an alteration, it is important to define the work area.
28
29	Work Area. A work area is that portion or portions of a building consisting of all reconfigured spaces as
30	indicated on the construction documents. A work area excludes other portions of the building where
31	incidental work entailed by the intended work must be performed and portions of the building where work
32	not initially intended by the owner is specifically required by this code.
33
34	503602.1 Alteration – Level 1 Scope
35
36	Level 1 alterations include the Removal and replacement, or covering of existing materials, elements
37	equipment, and or fixtures using new materials, elements, equipment, or fixtures that serve the same
38	purpose
39	Does not include reconfiguration of space
40
41	Commentary: Typically, the component (delegate) engineer (such as engineering companies who are
42	building component design engineers) serves as the only engineer for this level alteration and do not
43	need to provide host reactions for others or require shop drawing approval. Since there is typically no
44	architect or engineer above the component engineer, the component engineer produces work either at
45	the master plan sheet (non-site specific) level or addresses a site-specific condition with the assistance of
46	the permitting contractor to develop a code compliant solution.
47
48	504603.1 Alteration – Level 2 Scope
49
50	Level 2 alterations include the Reconfiguration of spaces, the addition or elimination of any door or
51	window, the reconfiguration or extension of any system, or the installation of additional system.
52	Reconfiguration of spaces (i.e., removal and addition of walls that could alter paths of egress
53	The addition or elimination of any door or window
54	Reconfiguration or extension of any system or installation of new equipment such as HVAC, electrical,
55	plumbing systems, etc.
56	Requirements for improvements or upgrade outside the scope of work exist in this category
57	Full compliance with the Code for new construction is not required
58	Applies where the work area is less than 50% of the aggregate area of the building
59
 
1	Commentary: Typically, there is an architect and/or engineer of record (AOR/EOR) on level 2 alterations
2	that receives the component engineers’ information for approval and incorporation in their design.
3	Component engineers cannot make the final decisions on design work and are subject to AOR/EOR
4	review and approval. The contractor typically facilitates coordination between trades, but at times the
5	component engineers work directly with the AOR/EOR for approval. Notes and disclaimers exist on the
6	component engineers’ plans to ensure compliance and limited liability that they are serving as component
7	engineers. In cases where there is no AOR/EOR, the commentary from level 1 applies.
8
9	505 604.1 Alteration – Level 3 Scope
10
11	Level 3 alterations apply Alteration Level 3 is just like level 2 alteration except where the work area
12	exceeds 50% of the aggregate building area of the building (total floors area).
13	Triggers in this classification are work that potentially affects the building’s fire protections systems,
14	vertical openings, means of egress, accessibility, and structural system.
15
16	Commentary: The notes from level 2 commentary apply with the exception that there would nearly
17	always be an AOR/EOR at this alteration level. Building component engineers would not engage fully in a
18	project of this alteration level and serve exclusively as the component engineer.
19
20	So, essentially, Level 1 is replacement, Level 2 is replacement with changes, and Level 3 is a major
21	remodeling.
22
23	CHAPTER 6 4 REPAIRS
24
25	The concept of repairs is simple; an item is not working as originally intended, it is broken, and we want it
26	to work again
27
28	The definition of repair from Chapter 2, Section 202 is as follows:
29
30	[A] Repair. The reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing building for the purpose of its
31	maintenance or to correct damage.
32
33	It is important to note this does not state “replace.” A repair is intended to allow an existing portion of a
34	building or structure to perform as it was originally intended.
35
36	Chapter 6 4 of the Existing Building volume provides additional guidance. One of the important sections
37	for a repair is 601.2 401.2.
38
39	601.2 401.2 Conformance
40
41	The work shall not make the building any less compliant conforming than it was before the repair was
42	made undertaken.
43
44	Section 602 402 provides for the materials used for repairs.
45
46	Note: Chapter 6 Repairs has been relocated to Chapter 4. The provisions of the prescriptive compliance
47	method of Chapter 4 have been relocated to Chapter 5. Classification of work in Chapter 5 has been
48	relocated to Chapter 6. Criteria related to repairs in other chapters has been deleted.
49
50	602.1 Existing Building Materials
51
52	Materials already in use in a building in compliance with requirements or approvals in effect at the time of
53	their erection or installation shall be permitted to remain in use unless determined by the code official to
54	render the building or structure unsafe or dangerous as defined in Chapter 2.
55
56	Dangerous: Any building, structure, or portion thereof that meets any of the conditions described below
57	shall be deemed dangerous:
58
59	The building or structure has collapsed, has partially collapsed, has moved off its foundation, or lacks the
 
1	necessary support of the ground.
2	There exists a significant risk of collapse, detachment or dislodgement of any portion, member,
3	appurtenance or ornamentation of the building or structure under service loads.
4
5	Materials in the building may remain unless determined by the Building Official to render the building
6	unsafe or dangerous.
7
8	•	Note: Section deleted. Requirements are covered in Section 302.3
9
10	602.2 402.2 New and Replacement Materials
11
12	Except as otherwise required or permitted by this code, materials permitted by the applicable code for
13	new construction shall be used. Like materials shall be permitted for repairs and alterations, provided no
14	dangerous or unsafe condition, as defined in Chapter 2, is created. Hazardous materials, such as
15	asbestos and lead-based paint, shall not be used where the code for new construction would not permit
16	their use in buildings of similar occupancy, purpose, and location.
17
18	Exception: Repairs to a historic building shall be permitted using original or like materials. Materials shall
19	comply with Sections 602.2, 602.3 and 602.4 402.1, 402.2 and 402.3
20
21	602.3 402.2 Glazing in Hazardous Locations
 
22
23	Replacement glazing in hazardous areas locations must shall comply with the safety glazing
24	requirements found in of the Florida Building Code, Building or Florida Building Code, Residential as
25	applicable.
26
27	602.4 402.3 Replacement
28
29	For repairs in an historic building, replacement, or partial replacement of existing or missing features that
30	match the original in configuration, height, size, and original methods of construction shall be permitted.
31
32	Exception: Glazing in hazardous locations shall comply with Section 602.3 402.2.
33
34	Finally, the intent of a repair is to allow the building or structure to continue to the end of its useful life.
35	During repairs, the key is to not make the building any less safe than exists. For structural repairs, we
36	need to determine if it is “substantial” structural damage or repair through:
37
38	Evaluation
39	Extent of repair
40	If it involves load carrying components
41
42	One exception to the general rule regarding existing components is electrical modifications. Replacement
43	of electrical receptacles requires compliance with section 406.4(D) of the electrical code This portion of
44	the electrical code specifies how to handle replacement of receptacles. It also requires GFCI protection to
45	be provided if required and, if AFCI protection is required, it must be installed.
46
 

1	CHAPTER 10 CHANGE OF OCCUPANCY
2
3	1001.2 Certificate of Occupancy
4
5	A change of occupancy or a change of occupancy within a space where there is a different fire protection
6	system threshold requirement in Chapter 9 of the Florida Building Code, Building shall not be made to
7	any structure without the approval of the code official. A certificate of occupancy shall be issued where it
8	has been determined that the requirements for the change of occupancy have been met.
9
10	1001.2.1 Change of Use
11
12	Any work undertaken in connection with a change in use that does not involve a change of occupancy
13	classification or a change to another group within an occupancy classification shall conform to the
14	applicable requirements for the work as classified in Chapter 5 and to the requirements of Sections 1002
15	through 1011.
16
17	Exception: As modified in Section 1205 for historic buildings. 1001.2.2 Change of occupancy
18	classification or group. Where the occupancy classification of a building changes, the provisions of
19	Sections 1002 through 1012 shall apply. This includes a change of occupancy classification and a change
20	to another group within an occupancy classification.
21
22	1001.2.2.1 Partial Change of Occupancy
23
24	Where the occupancy classification or group of a portion of an existing building is changed, Section 1012
25	shall apply.
26
27	1001.3 Certificate of occupancy required
28
29	A certificate of occupancy shall be issued where a change of occupancy occurs that results in a different
30	occupancy classification as determined by the Florida Building Code, Building.
31
32	1203 Standards and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings
33
34	1203.1 Historic Preservation Goal
35
36	The historic preservation goal of this code shall be to minimize damage to and loss of historic structures,
37	their unique characteristics, and their contents as follows:
38
39	Maintain and preserve original space configurations of historic buildings
40	Minimize alteration, destruction or loss of historic fabric or design.
41
42	The six primary objectives for preserving these structures are listed below.
43
44	1203.2 Historic Preservation Objectives
45
46	Preservation of the original qualities or character of a building, structure, site, or environment shall be
47	encouraged.
48	Removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features shall be minimized.
49	Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a building, structure or
50	site shall be treated with sensitivity.
51	A compatible use for a property that requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its
52	environment shall be encouraged.
53	New additions or alterations shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that if such additions or
54	alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be
55	unimpaired to the greatest degree possible.
 
1	Repairs, alterations, restorations, changes of occupancy, additions, and relocations shall be guided by
2	the recommended approaches in rehabilitation set forth in the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
3	Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (Appendix B).
4
5	1205 Compliance
6
7	1205.1 Strict Compliance
8
9	Historic structures or portions of such structures that do not strictly comply with this code shall be
10	considered to be in compliance if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the building code official that
11	equivalent protection has been provided or that no hazard will be created or continued through
12	noncompliance.
13
14	CHAPTER 15 CONSTRUCTION SAFEGUARDS
15
16	1504 Fire Extinguishers
17
18	[F] 1504.1 Where Required
19
20	All structures under construction, alteration, or demolition shall be provided with not less than one
21	approved portable fire extinguisher in accordance with the Florida Fire Prevention Code and sized for not
22	less than ordinary hazard as follows:
23
24	At each stairway on all floor levels where combustible materials have accumulated
25	In every storage and construction shed
26	Additional portable fire extinguishers shall be provided where special hazards exist including, but not
27	limited to, the storage and use of flammable and combustible liquids
28
29	SUMMARY
30
31	As can be seen by these rules, existing buildings, which make up the majority of the built environment,
32	are permitted to remain in use and be maintained. The code is concerned for the ongoing safety of the
33	users of the buildings. Provided structures are maintained in a safe and free of danger status, the code
34	permits their ongoing use.
