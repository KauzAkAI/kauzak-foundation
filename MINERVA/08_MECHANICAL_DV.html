5	IDENTIFYING PARTS OF THE SYSTEM
6
7	HVAC
8
9	Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC): refers to the different systems used for moving air
10	between indoor and outdoor areas, along with heating and cooling both residential and commercial
11	buildings. They are the systems that keep you warm and cozy in the winter and feeling cool and fresh in
12	the summer. They also filter and clean indoor air to keep you healthy and maintain humidity levels at
13	optimal comfort levels.
14
15	HVAC is a common term that people use, and most have a general idea of what it's referring to. On the
16	other hand, how does HVAC work?
17
18	Air Handlers
19
20	An air handler's main function is to circulate the air in the system, and the components surrounding it alter
21	the functionalities of heating, cooling, and air quality.
22
23	Although there are multiple ways and places you can install an air handler, the unit connects to the rest of
24	the home through a series of supply and return ventilation ducts that recirculate the air in each room.
25
26	Air handlers can be paired with an air conditioner, heat pump, and sometimes even a mini split system for
27	both heating and cooling functions. Additionally, air handlers can also be equipped with a heating coil to
28	provide supplementary heat.
29
30	Components of an Air Handler
31
32	Just like a furnace, air handlers contain a blower (fan), controls, and an evaporator coil that conditions
33	and recirculates the air in a home. The air handler works with the outdoor unit (a condenser or heat
34	pump) in a typical split system by using refrigerant lines that connect the two systems.
35
36	Depending on where you live, the parts that make up the system will change. The components listed
37	below are found in the typical heat-pump/air conditioning setups.
38
39	Blower motor: Moves air through the connected ductwork to circulate throughout the home.
40	•	Single and multi-speed motors will run at set revolutions per minute (RPM) and are capable of
41	moving consistent amounts of air, measured in cubic feet per minute.
42	•	Variable speed motors, sometimes known as an electronically commutated motor (ECM), monitor
43	changing conditions and adjust those outputs for maximized efficiency.
44
45	Plenum connectors: These are air-collection boxes that connect the supply and return ductwork
46	throughout the home to the air handler.
47
48	Air filter: Air filters protect the internal components by capturing particulates from the incoming air.
49
50	Condensers
51
52	A condenser is a device or unit used to condense a gaseous substance into a liquid state through cooling.
53	In so doing, the latent heat is released by the substance and transferred to the surrounding environment.
54
55	The four main parts of refrigerating and air conditioning systems are the compressor, condenser,
56	throttling or expansion valve, and the evaporator. The refrigerant leaving the compressor is in the
57	gaseous state, and at a high pressure and temperature. This refrigerant then enters the condenser where
58	it loses the heat to the coolant that can be air or water. After passing through the condenser, the
59	refrigerant is condensed but still remains at high pressure. It comes out in a partially liquid and gaseous
 
1	state, then enters the throttling or expansion valve.
2
3	The three types of condensers are air cooled, water cooled, and evaporative. These are described below.
4
5	Air cooled condensers: Air cooled condensers are used in small units like household refrigerators, deep
6	freezers, water coolers, window air conditioners, split air conditioners, small-packaged air conditioners,
7	etc. These are used in plants where the cooling load is small and the total quantity of the refrigerant in the
8	refrigeration cycle is small. Air cooled condensers are also called coil condensers as they are usually
9	made of copper or aluminum coil. They occupy a comparatively larger space than water cooled
10	condensers. The two types of air-cooled condensers are natural convection and forced convection.
11	•	In the natural convection type, the air flows over it in natural a way depending upon the
12	temperature of the condenser coil.
13	•	In the forced air type, a fan operated by a motor blows air over the condenser coil.
14
15	Water cooled condensers: Water cooled condensers are used for large refrigerating plants, big,
16	packaged air conditioners, central air conditioning plants, etc. These are used in plants where cooling
17	loads are excessively high and a large quantity of refrigerant flows through the condenser. The three
18	types of water-cooled condensers are tube-in-tube or double pipe type, shell and coil type and shell and
19	tube type. In all these condensers the refrigerant flows through one side of the piping while the water
20	flows through the other side, cooling and condensing the refrigerant.
21
22	Evaporative condensers: Evaporative condensers are usually used in ice plants. They are a
23	combination of water cooled and air-cooled condensers. In these condensers, the hot refrigerant flows
24	through the coils. Water is sprayed over these coils. At the same time, the fan draws air from the bottom
25	side of the condenser and discharges it from the top side of the condenser. The spray water that comes
26	in contact with the condenser coil is evaporated, absorbs the heat from the condenser, and cools and
27	condenses the refrigerant. Evaporative condensers have the benefits of both water cooled and air-cooled
28	condensers, so they occupy less space. However, keeping the evaporative condensers clean and free of
29	scale is difficult and requires lots of maintenance. For this reason, they are not favored by HVAC
30	designers.
31
32	Ductwork
33
34	Ductwork channels conditioned air to vents, takes return air back into the system, and transports exhaust
35	air and waste heat to the exterior of a home. Ducts serve a triple purpose: They carry warmth in winter,
36	hold cool air in summer, and provide ventilation for better indoor air quality throughout the year. Because
37	they’re in use almost every day, the ducts need occasional maintenance to improve the longevity of the
38	heating and air conditioning equipment.
39
40	How it Works
41
42	The air conditioner (AC) processes two air sources: return air and supply air. Depending on the building’s
43	construction, there may also be exhaust air ducts in the home, especially if the home is a multi-story
44	building, but most single-family homes use only supply and return ducts. Supply air comes from outside
45	the building via the ventilation system. Return air goes through the filter and into ducts that mix it with
46	supply air in a space called the plenum. The air in the plenum cools slightly as it combines external air
47	and recirculated air, but it is not until the air moves over the evaporator coils that it loses most of its heat
48
49	The ducts that carry air to vents are separate from the return air ducts that bring air to the plenum and
50	through the main blower. The filters that remove smoke, dust, and other particulate matter from return air
51	serve a vital purpose and help keep the AC system’s coils clean. Clean coils are efficient coils, because
52	the evaporator coils carry coolant ready for its freight of excess heat, the coils’ fins must be free of soil
53	that could hamper thermal transfer.
54
 
1	Types of Air Ducts
2
3	The two major types of air ducts are defined below.
4
5	Rigid ducts: Rigid ducts are typically more expensive to install, but they are durable and quiet if the
6	home has the space for them. Rigid materials are also easy to seal and clean. For forced-air systems,
7	rigid materials maintain air pressure better than flexible options, which is why many homes use them for
8	main trunk ductwork and use flexible materials for offshoots. The most common material for rigid ducting
9	is galvanized steel, but polyurethane panels with additional insulation are becoming increasingly popular
10	for new construction. Fiberglass panels are another possibility for rigid duct systems; they are well
11	insulated and lightweight.
12
13	Flexible ducts: Flexible ducting, or flex, allows the AC installation specialist to fit ducts into smaller
14	spaces and around existing architectural elements. Flex ducts are economical and compact, making them
15	a good choice for reaching vents near corners or close to the house’s eaves. Today, most flexible ducts
16	are made from metal coils wrapped with insulating materials and polyethylene plastic, but older ducts may
17	incorporate other plastics and metal films. When installing flexible ducts, ventilation technicians should
18	avoid bending or kinking the wire within the tubing. Over short distances of under 15 feet and with no
19	sharp bends, flexible ducts can approach the efficiency of rigid duct materials.
20
21	OTHER SYSTEMS
22
23	Exhaust Systems
24
25	An exhaust system is defined as, an assembly of connected ducts, plenums, fittings, registers, grilles, and
26	hoods through which air is conducted from the space or spaces and exhausted to the outdoor
27	atmosphere. It also serves to extract water and greasy vapor, smoke, fumes, toxic gases, obnoxious
28	odors, heat, and aerosols out of the building. An exhaust system is found in kitchens, bathrooms, or any
29	area that has a combustible energy source.
30

39	rate of outdoor air shall be reduced in accordance with such engineered system design.
40
41	403.2.1 Recirculation of Air
42
43	The outdoor air required by Section 403.3 shall not be recirculated. Air in excess of that required by
44	Section 403.3 shall not be prohibited from being recirculated as a component of supply air to building
45	spaces, except that:
46
47	Ventilation air shall not be recirculated from one dwelling to another or to dissimilar occupancies.
48	Supply air to a swimming pool and associated deck areas shall not be recirculated unless such air is
49	dehumidified to maintain the relative humidity of the area at 60 percent or less. Air from this area shall not
50	be recirculated to other spaces where more than 10 percent of the resulting supply airstream consists of
51	air recirculated from these spaces.
52	Where mechanical exhaust is required by Note b in Table 403.3.1.1, recirculation of air from such spaces
53	shall be prohibited. Recirculation of air that is contained completely within such spaces shall not be
54	prohibited. Where recirculation of air is prohibited, all air supplied to such spaces shall be exhausted,
55	including any air in excess of that required by Table 403.3.1.1.
56	Where mechanical exhaust is required by Note g in Table 403.3.1.1, mechanical exhaust is required and
57	recirculation from such spaces is prohibited where more than 10 percent of the resulting supply airstream
58	consists of air recirculated from these spaces. Recirculation of air that is contained completely within such
59	spaces shall not be prohibited.
 
1
2	403.2.2 Transfer Air
3
4	Except where recirculation from such spaces is prohibited by Table 403.3.1.1, air transferred from
5	occupiable spaces is not prohibited from serving as makeup air for required exhaust systems in such
6	spaces as kitchens, baths, toilet rooms, elevators, and smoking lounges. The amount of transfer air and
7	exhaust air shall be sufficient to provide the flow rates as specified in Section 403.3.1.1. The required
8	outdoor airflow rates specified in Table 403.3.1.1 shall be introduced directly into such spaces or into the
9	occupied spaces from which air is transferred or a combination of both.
10
11	403.3 Outdoor air and local exhaust airflow rates.

21	Group R-2, R-3, and R-4 three stories and less above grade plane shall comply with Sections 403.3.1.1
22	through 403.3.1.5.
23
24	403.3.1.1 Outdoor Airflow Rate
25
26	Ventilation systems shall be designed to have the capacity to supply the minimum outdoor airflow rate,
27	determined in accordance with this section. In each occupiable space, the ventilation system shall be
28	designed to deliver the required rate of outdoor airflow to the breathing zone. The occupant load utilized
29	for design of the ventilation system shall be not less than the number determined from the estimated
30	maximum occupant load rate indicated in Table 403.3.1.1. Ventilation rates for occupancies not
31	represented in Table 403.3.1.1 shall be those for a listed occupancy classification that is most similar in
32	terms of occupant density, activities and building construction; or shall be determined by an approved
33	engineering analysis. The ventilation system shall be designed to supply the required rate of ventilation
34	air continuously during the period the building is occupied, except as otherwise stated in other provisions
35	of the code.
36
37	With the exception of smoking lounges, the ventilation rates in Table 403.3.1.1 are based on the absence
38	of smoking in occupiable spaces. Where smoking is anticipated in a space other than a smoking lounge,
39	the ventilation system serving the space shall be designed to provide ventilation over and above that
40	required by Table 403.3.1.1 in accordance with accepted engineering practice.
41
42	Exception: The occupant load is not required to be determined based on the estimated maximum
43	occupant load rate indicated in Table 403.3.1.1 where approved statistical data document the accuracy of
44	an alternate anticipated occupant density.
45
46	Exhaust Hoods
47
48	An exhaust hood is a device containing a mechanical fan that hangs above the stove or cooktop in the
49	kitchen. It removes airborne grease, combustion products, fumes, smoke, heat, and steam from the air by
50	evacuation of the air and filtration. In commercial kitchens, exhaust hoods are often used in combination
51	with fire suppression devices so that fumes from a grease fire are properly vented and the fire is put out
52	quickly. Commercial vent hoods may also be combined with a fresh air fan that draws in exterior air,
53	circulating it with the cooking fumes that are then drawn out by the hood.
54
55	In most exhaust hoods, a filtration system removes grease (the grease trap) and other particles. Although
56	many vents hoods exhaust air to the outside, some recirculate the air to the kitchen. In a recirculating
57	system, filters may be used to remove odors in addition to the grease.
58
59	SPLIT AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS
60
 

1	How does a Typical Split System Work?
2
3	A split air condition system is named as such because it has components that are located inside and
4	outside the home. It’s literally split into two pieces. It is as referred to as “central air.”
5
6	Consisting of an outdoor unit with a condenser and compressor, and an indoor unit with a fan and an
7	evaporator coil, a split air conditioning system works by removing warm air from a home and cycling it
8	back as cooler air through a system of supply and return ducts. Powered by electricity, the compressor
9	pumps refrigerant through the system to collect heat and moisture inside the home. That heat and
10	moisture is removed from the home when the warm air collected inside is blown over the cooled indoor
11	coil that cools the air. The heat transferred into the coil during this process is pumped outside the home,
12	while the cool air is cycled back inside.
13
14	A split air conditioning system is particularly effective in warmer climates, as it effectively keeps homes
15	cool and reduces humidity levels. It also features a lower indoor noise level compared to free-standing air
16	conditioning units, since its compressor-bearing unit is outside of the home. Central air conditioning
17	systems, such as a split system, provide the added benefit of air filtration because, as a “forced air”
18	system, air is drawn out of rooms through air returns and pulled through an air filter. This removes
19	airborne particles and results in cleaner, filtered air being redistributed to the home through air supply
20	ductwork.
21
22	Transfer the Heat
23
24	Heat is the amount of energy transferred due to temperature difference between two bodies. HVAC
25	equipment transfers thermal (heat) energy from one location to another.
26
27	Heat flows from areas of high temperature to areas of low temperature, according to the Second Law of
28	Thermodynamics. The HVAC system is responsible for reversing this natural flow, removing hot air from
29	buildings in the hot summers and placing it in buildings in the cold winters.
30
31	How does that happen? It’s all about the heat exchanger. A heat exchanger is a device that transfers
32	thermal energy from one medium to another.
33
34	How does a freon system work?
35
36	Refrigerant is a general term that refers to a chemical blend inside an electro-mechanical air conditioner
37	that can shift easily between liquid and gaseous states. The earliest refrigerants were toxic or
38	combustible, which made air conditioning impractical outside of industrial buildings. But the invention of
39	the first non-toxic refrigerant blend, known by the trademarked name Freon, allowed air conditioners to
40	enter home use and spread across the country. The current standard refrigerant blend for residential air
41	conditioners is R-410A, sometimes called Puron, which produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than
42	the previous blend, R-22.
43
44	As refrigerant transmutes from liquid to gas and back, it absorbs and releases heat. This is how it is
45	capable of cooling down a home. The compressor changes liquid refrigerant into a high-pressure, high-
46	temperature gas. The refrigerant moves to the outside coil of the air conditioner and releases its heat
47	there through condensation, cooling down. By the time it reaches the indoor coil, it has cooled down to
48	the point that it causes evaporation when it meets the warmer indoor air. This siphons heat from the air,
49	cooling it down. The refrigerant, once again a liquid, returns to the compressor to restart the cycle.
50
51	The refrigerant will remain at the same level for the life of the air conditioner unless leaks occur. If the
52	refrigerant level (its charge) starts to drop, professionals need to repair the system as soon as possible.
53	Low refrigerant will not only lower the cooling ability of the AC, but it can also severely damage the
54	compressor.

28	THE EVOLUTION OF MECHANICAL SYSTEMS
29
30	The Original - Ice on the Roof
31
32	In the 1830s, at the Florida hospital where he worked, Dr. John Gorrie built an ice-making machine that
33	used compression to make buckets of ice and then blew air over them. He patented the idea in 1851,
34	imagining his invention cooling buildings all over the world. But without any financial backing, his dream
35	melted away.
36
37	In 1881, after an assassin shot President James Garfield on July 2nd, naval engineers built a boxy
38	makeshift cooling unit to keep him cool and comfortable. The device was filled with water-soaked cloth
39	and a fan that blew hot air overhead and kept the cool air closer to the ground. The good news: This
40	device could lower room temperature by up to 20 degrees F. The bad news: It used a half-million pounds
41	of ice in two months … and President Garfield still died.
42
43	Systems Through Time
44
45	The Romans and Greeks used similar tactics to keep themselves cool. Though it was not until technology
46	accommodated advancements that the heating and air conditioning, we know today began taking shape.
47	1830s - Dr. John Gorrie of Florida wanted to provide a way to shorten recovery time for patients.
48	Believing that bad air was the root of illness, Gorrie used buckets of ice then blew air over them, resulting
49	in a cooling effect.
50	1861 - William Siemens learned how to super heat coils with electricity. He installed a fan to blow air
51	through it, inventing the first electric furnace.
52	1881 – After President James Garfield was shot, to provide him relief, naval engineers soaked pieces of
53	cloth in cold water and ice, then spun a fan over them.
54	1902 - Willis Carrier of New York invented an apparatus of chilled coils to control the temperature and
55	humidity of a room. This machine was primarily utilized in businesses where high temperature and
56	humidity levels ruined products, like ink and paper.
 

1	•	Carrier’s first air conditioning units were large, costly, and dangerous as they used significant
2	amounts of ammonia. These units are used only in sizeable buildings like hotels, textile mills, and
3	hospitals.
4	1914 - The first air-conditioned home was in Minneapolis, MN. Unfortunately, the HVAC unit was still
5	enormous. It towered at 7 feet and ran 20 feet along the room.
6	•	For the next fifteen years, movie theaters were outfitted with heating and cooling systems. Being
7	able to provide a cool environment increased sales and attendance dramatically during the
8	summer, allowing businesses to boom all year round.
9	1922 - Willis Carrier made two huge upgrades to his heating and cooling unit system. First, he replaced
10	ammonia with dyeline, a safer coolant for heating and air conditioning. Then, he reduced the size of the
11	unit. This allowed for HVAC to be available in more places like office suites, shopping malls, and railroad
12	cars.
13	•	Within the next few years, central buildings like the House of Representatives, White House, and
14	Executive Office Building were fitted with HVAC.
15	•	Unfortunately, rapid advancements for heating and air conditioning stopped. With the start of
16	World War II, commerce shifted toward producing military equipment. However, once the war was
17	over, Americans found that the economy was stronger than ever. There was an enormous surge
18	of sales in home heating and air conditioning.
19	1942 - The U.S. built a power plant specifically to keep up with the growing load of electricity demanded
20	from heating and air conditioning.
21	1953 - Over one million HVAC units were sold.
22	1950s - Improvements to the heating and cooling systems continued to be made. By the late 1950s,
23	motors were made to work more quietly, refrigeration was more efficient, and the HVAC unit was
24	relatively compact.
25	1970s - The central air system took over single heating and cooling units.
26	2011 - Up to 100 million American homes had heating and air conditioning. Experts and engineers in the
27	HVAC industry continued to make improvements, making it safer, smarter, and easier to heat and cool
28	buildings.

30	IMPACT OF THE ENERGY CODE
31
32	Building energy codes represent a significant savings opportunity for U.S. home and business owners.
33	Model energy codes for residential and commercial buildings are projected to save (cumulative 2010-
34	2040):
35
36	$126 billion energy cost savings
37	841 MMT of avoided CO2 emissions
38	12.82 quads of primary energy
39
40	These savings equate to the annual emissions of:
41
42	177 million passenger vehicles
43	245 coal power plants
44	89 million homes
