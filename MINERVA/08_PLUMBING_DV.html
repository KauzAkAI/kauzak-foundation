7
8	101.2 Scope
9
10	The provisions of this code shall apply to the erection, installation, alteration, repairs, relocation,
11	replacement, addition to, use or maintenance of plumbing systems within this jurisdiction. This code shall
12	regulate nonflammable medical gas, inhalation anesthetic, vacuum piping, nonmedical oxygen systems
13	and sanitary and condensate vacuum collection systems. The installation of fuel gas distribution piping
14	and equipment, fuel-gas-fired water heaters, and water heater venting systems shall be regulated by the
15	International Fuel Gas Code. Provisions in the appendices shall not apply unless specifically adopted.
16
17	Exception: Detached one- and two-family dwellings and multiple single-family dwellings (townhouses)
18	not more than three stories high with separate means of egress and their accessory structures shall
19	comply with the International Residential Code.
20
21	[A] 101.3 Intent
22
23	The purpose of this code is to establish minimum standards to provide a reasonable level of safety,
24	health, property protection, and public welfare by regulating and controlling the design, construction,
25	installation, quality of materials, location, operation, and maintenance or use of plumbing equipment and
26	systems.
27
28	[A] 101.4 Severability
29
30	If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this code is for any reason held to be
31	unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this code.
32
33	IDENTIFYING PARTS OF THE SYSTEM
34
35	Service Disconnects
36
37	Knowing how and where to turn off or reset an electric breaker or replace a fuse. All systems need a
38	method of being shut off from the supply.
39
40	Every building was required to have a main water shut-off valve installed inside the home during initial
41	construction. So, for most emergencies or repairs, shutting off the proper inside valve is as important as
42	knowing how and where to shut off a buildings main water supply. There are also underground shut-off
43	valves installed at the property line; if shutting off this valve is necessary.
 

1	Background
2
3	It is important to understand that different plumbing arrangements will dictate where the proper main
4	supply valve is located, such as the following:
5
6	Some buildings have the water meter located inside, while others are located outside, underground within
7	a “pit” at or near the property line or right-of-way. Some homes also have submeters that are typically
8	inside even if the main meter is outside/underground.
9	Newer homes have fire sprinkler systems, while older ones generally do not.
10	Home construction also differs greatly as in basements, crawlspaces, and slab-on-grade.
11	Water shut-off valves may have round “wheel” handles or lever handles.
12
13	Locating the Proper Valve
14
15	Basements: The shut-off valve is typically located near the front foundation wall. The main water may
16	have come through the concrete floor or through the wall. The valve is typically within 3-5 feet of where
17	the main water enters. In some cases, the main water may enter in a different area, like a mechanical
18	room, up through the floor, or near the water heater or furnace.
19
20	Crawlspace with no basement: The shut off valve will typically be located near the water heater or
21	under the kitchen sink, but anywhere is possible. As mentioned above, it may be inside the crawlspace; in
22	which case, you may want to consider a secondary valve located up in the living space (near the water
23	heater or under a sink).
24
25	Slab-on-grade construction: The shut-off valve will typically be located near the water heater or under
26	the kitchen sink, but anywhere is possible.
27
28	Choosing the Proper Valve to Operate
29
30	If a home has a fire sprinkler system, care is needed when selecting a shut-off valve. Unless it is a
31	sprinkler pipe that is leaking, you should only shut off the home’s plumbing supply and leave the sprinkler
32	piping charged/live.
33
34	If the water shutdown is for a broken sprinkler line or sprinkler head, then locate the first valve (closest to
35	the main water line entry point) and operate that valve as described below.
36	For all other general plumbing shut offs, emergency, and non-emergency:
37
38	For homes with fire sprinklers and an inside main water meter, locate and operate the second valve, it will
39	be above the main meter and past (downstream) of the fire sprinkler system “tee.” If you have a
40	submeter, its second valve will only isolate the irrigation and/or hose bibs.
41	For homes with fire sprinklers and an outside main water meter, locate and operate the second valve, it
42	will be past (downstream) of the fire sprinkler “tee.”
43	For homes without fire sprinklers and with an inside main water meter, either valve will shut off the supply
44	to the home but operating the second valve is a good practice and a safeguard if you are unsure of
45	whether the home has fire sprinklers or not.
46	For homes without fire sprinklers and with an outside main water meter, there will likely only be one shut-
47	off valve that will shut down the entire home.
 

1	Backflow
2
3	A backflow preventer is a device that’s installed on a home’s water pipes that allows water to flow in one
4	direction but never in the opposite direction. Its sole job is to prevent drinking water from being
5	contaminated due to backflow.
6
7	How Backflow Happens
8
9	When water enters a home from the main water supply line, it should only ever flow in one direction - into
10	a home.
11
12	But sometimes, due to pressure changes in the pipes, that water can actually flow backwards and seep
13	back into the main water supply line.
14
15	For example, backflow can happen when there’s a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is
16	opened for use. Because pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward
17	into the home and will flow backwards into the city water lines. When this happens, backflow can
18	contaminate the public drinking supply with:
19
20	•	Fertilizers/pesticides
21	•	Human waste
22	•	Chlorine from pools/spas
23	•	Soap from sinks/dishwashers/showers
24
25	That’s where a backflow prevention system comes in handy. Let’s take a closer look at how a backflow
26	prevention system works.
27
28	Backflow Prevention System
29
30	Backflow prevention systems are devices installed onto a pipe that only allow water to flow in one
31	direction. Think of it as a one-way gate that allows water from the city’s public water supply to flow into a
32	home’s piping but stops water when it tries to flow backwards into the main water supply.
33
34	The parts you can’t see are described below.
35
36	Every habitable dwelling, and most commercial buildings have at least two plumbing systems, a potable
37	water supply and a drainage waste system (also called a drain, waste, and vent system). The potable
38	water supply system is used to deliver water to a building and to the fixtures within that building.
39
40	Once that water is used, and sent down the drain, the drainage and waste system are in charge of
41	disposing it; usually via the municipal sewage treatment system, or a septic system.
42
43	Supply lines: Water supply lines are installed for the purpose of supplying fresh water into the building.
44	In a bathroom, water supply line means connecting plumbing fixtures with the main water distribution line
45	of the building with pipes, so that water can reach them.
46
47	Federal law enacted in January 2014, requires pipe, pipe fittings, joints, valves, faucets, and fixture
48	fittings that are used to supply water for drinking or cooking to have not more than 25% lead content and
49	must comply with NSF 372.
50
51	Drains: Drainage is the method of removing surface or sub-surface water from a given area. Drainage
52	systems include all of the piping within a private or public property that conveys sewage, rainwater, and
53	other liquid waste to a point of disposal. The main objective of a drainage system is to collect and remove
54	waste matter systematically to maintain healthy conditions in a building. Drainage systems are designed
55	to dispose of wastewater as quickly as possible and should prevent gases from sewers and septic tanks
56	from entering residential areas.
57
58	The drain system within a home, works entirely by gravity, allowing wastewater to flow downhill through a
59	series of large diameter pipes. These drainpipes are connected to a vent pipe system that bring fresh air
60	to the drainpipes, preventing suction that would either stop or slow the free flow of wastewater. Vent pipes
 
1	exit the building through one or more roof vents. Care must be taken to ensure that these roof vents do
2	not become clogged. Leaves and bird nests are two ways in which these roof vents can become clogged.
3
4	All wastewater flows to the main waste and vent stack. The main stack curves to become a sewer line
5	that exits the building near the foundation. In a municipal system, this is a sewer line. Where sewer
6	service is not available, the line runs to a septic system that is simply a mini-wastewater treatment facility.
7
8	•	Traps: A plumbing drain trap is designed to retain a small amount of water each time the sink
9	drains, and this water standing in the bottom of the curved portion of the trap seals the drain and
10	keeps sewer gasses from escaping the drain and entering the home. The following types of traps
11	are prohibited:
12	o Traps that depend on moving parts to maintain the seal
13	o Bell traps
14	o Crown-vented traps
15	o Traps not integral with a fixture and that depend on interior partitions for the seal, except
16	those traps constructed of an approved material that is resistant to corrosion and degradation
17	o “S” traps
18	o Drum traps
19		Exception: Drum traps used as solids interceptors and drum traps serving
20	chemical waste systems shall not be prohibited.
21	o Each fixture trap shall have a liquid seal of not less than 2 inches (51 mm) and not more than
22	4 inches (102 mm), or deeper for special designs relating to accessible fixtures.
23
24	Sewer: Every building in which plumbing fixtures are installed and premises having drainage piping shall
25	be connected to a publicly owned or investor-owned sewage system, where available, or an approved
26	onsite sewage treatment and disposal system in accordance with F.A.C. 64E-6, Standards for Onsite
27	Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems.

23
24	401.3 Water Conservation
25
26	The maximum water flow rates and flush volume for plumbing fixtures and fixture fittings shall comply with
27	Section 604.4.
28
29	Water is one of our most important resources, as every living thing needs water to survive. Water
30	conservation means using less water or recycling used water so that it can be used again. This type of
31	program is important because water conservation helps save energy, protect wild animals, and prevent
32	people from using so much water that it cannot be replaced with rain. Water conservation also helps
33	people and governments save money.
34

17	user facilities that are or will be provided shall be permitted to comply with Section 810.2.
18
19	THE EVOLUTION OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
20
21	The Roman Empire first used lead and clay pipes for portable water that serviced private homes,
22	amphitheaters, and bathhouses throughout their empire. Lead was used throughout the United States for
23	water services that serviced homes and businesses up until the beginning of WWII. The fact that lead
24	was very flexible and extremely durable made it an ideal piping material. The use of lead for potable
25	water declined after WWII because of the dangers of lead poisoning. Lead pipes are no longer used and
26	are still being replaced to this day in some of our larger older cities across the U.S.
27
28	Federal law enacted in January 2014, requires pipes, pipe fittings, joints, valves, faucets, and fixture
29	fittings that are used to supply water for drinking or cooking have not more than 25% lead content.
30
31	Common Plumbing Materials
32
33	The following materials are commonly used in the plumbing trade.
34
35	Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): Of the different types of plastic pipe used for water supply, PVC has a wide
36	variety of plumbing uses, from drainage pipe to water mains. It is most commonly used for irrigation
37	piping, home and building supply piping, and pool and spa systems. PVC is often white, but it can also
38	come in other colors. You can often tell what it is used for by the colors and mark on the pipe. For
39	example, purple pipe with black lettering is used for reclaimed water. PVC also comes in a variety of
40	thicknesses called schedules. Schedule 40 is the most common for water distribution.
41
42	Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC): It is often (but not always) a cream-colored or off-white plastic.
43	This type of pipe can stand temperatures up to about 180 degrees F or so (this depends on the
44	schedule), so it and can be used for hot and cold water inside of a house or mobile home. Since CPVC is
45	the same outside diameter as copper and PEX, the same push-fit fittings, such as SharkBite, will fit the
46	CPVC piping.
47
48	As with PVC, you should use primer and glue when making a CPVC joint. Also, make sure the glue you
49	are using says that is can be used on CPVC. This glue is usually a different color, such as orange, so you
50	know that it is used for CPVC. There are also "universal" pipe glues that are designed to work with many
51	different types of plastic pipe.
52
53	Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX): PEX is commonly used for hot and cold water in homes, and for
54	hydronic heating systems, such as radiant under-floor systems due to its resistance to hot and cold
55	temperatures. PEX is widely used for its competitive pricing, ease of use, and the long rolls of piping that
56	it can come in. PEX can be joined in many different ways including push-fit fittings and specialty PEX
57	tools used with crimp rings to secure the joints.
58
59	This type of pipe is mostly used for hot and cold-water distribution, as well as being regularly used in
 
1	HVAC systems for refrigerant lines. Although once used in gas piping, this is no longer allowed in most
2	jurisdictions.
3
4	Copper: Copper piping works in both underground and above-ground applications, but copper can be
5	affected by some soils and should be sleeved if used underground. Due to the price of copper and longer
6	labor needed to install it, many builders are switching to alternative water distributions piping, such as
7	PEX.
8
9	Copper comes in different thicknesses that are labeled M, L, and K, with M being the thinnest. Copper
10	pipes can be connected in different ways, including compression fittings or with a torch so you can sweat
11	solder it.
