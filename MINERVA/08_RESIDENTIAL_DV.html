51	•	The total net area of non-engineered openings shall be not less than 1 square inch (645 mm2) for
52	each square foot (0.093 m2) of enclosed area where the enclosed area is measured on the
53	exterior of the enclosure walls, or the openings shall be designed as engineered openings and
54	the construction documents shall include a statement by a registered design professional that the
55	design of the openings will provide for equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
