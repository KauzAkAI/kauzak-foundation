PREFACE
Gold Coast thanks all of our current and former students who have helped us become the most
prestigious construction school in Florida. Some of you may have obtained your licensing education from
us back in 1970, while others may have received it recently. You are the reason we are in business. If
there is anything that we can do to assist you, please ask.
We have strived to make the continuing education book enjoyable, informative, and relatable to day-today life. This year we are pleased to provide you with this correspondence course. The course syllabus is
found on the next few pages.
As a Gold Coast student, we want to make sure that you are aware of the laws, rules, and codes that
affect your license. While the following are not new law changes, they are nevertheless very important
laws and rules you should be aware of to protect your license and avoid fines.
• As you know, sole proprietors or partnerships cannot be exempt from the workers’ compensation
insurance requirement. For corporations, the exemption is still allowed for up to three corporate
officers who each own 10% or more of the company’s stock. Realize that a total of three exemptions
is also the limit for any “affiliated” grouping of companies (companies where the same individuals
have ownership).
• “Advance Module” Building Code update courses remain a part of the CE requirement of most
boards. Contractors need one hour; architects need two hours. Our program includes two of these
“Advanced Module” hours.
• Computer tracking is in place and 100% compliance is in force. The renewal of your license WILL
NOT be issued until you have completed all of the required CE hours. The statewide system
tracks license history, CE, and sanctions for both certified and registered contractors. It is
important for you to establish an online account with the DBPR. You can do this by visiting
myfloridalicense.com. Once your account is established, it is equally important to select the “Profile
Merge” feature. This will ensure that informational changes to one license will be carried forward to
all of your other licenses, if applicable.
We at Gold Coast School of Construction are working hard to keep up with these changes and look
forward to being your professional education provider both now and in the future.
Thank you to the team that put this book together including all of our authors, editors, and designers.
Sincerely,
Chris Clausing

WORKPLACE SAFETY
1
2 INTRODUCTION TO OSHA
3
4 OSHA Act of 1970
5
6 The Act: “To assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women; by authorizing
7 enforcement of the standards developed under the Act; by assisting and encouraging the States in their
8 efforts to assure safe and healthful working conditions; by providing for research, information, education,
9 and training in the field of occupational safety and health; and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the
10 Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that this
11 Act may be cited as the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act).
12
13 OSHA’s Mission
14
15 With the OSH Act, Congress created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to
16 assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing
17 standards and by providing training, outreach, education, and assistance.
18
19 The OSH Act was passed to prevent workers from being killed or seriously harmed at work. This law
20 created the OSHA that sets and enforces protective workplace safety and health standards. OSHA also
21 provides information, training, and assistance to employers and workers.
22
23 Under the OSH Act, employers have the responsibility to provide a safe workplace.
24
25 In the field of training, over 35 years ago, OSHA established the Outreach Training Program with the
26 introduction of OSHA 10 hours and OSHA 30 hours. Over the past several years, more than 1.6 million
27 students have been trained. Today, the outreach program has a national network of over 16,000
28 independent trainers.
29
30 Federal OSHA Coverage and Statistics
31
32 OSHA is an official entity where all worker’s complaints should be heard and addressed accordingly.
33
34 It is the agency responsible for providing research, information, education, and training guidelines for any
35 area related to occupational safety and health.
36
37 OSHA provides standards for many industries; however, for this course we focus on the standards
38 relative to the construction industry, 29 CFR 1903, 1910, and primarily, 1926.
39
40 5,333 workers died on the job in 2019 https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm (3.5 per 100,000 full-
41 time equivalent workers) — on average, more than 100 a week or about 15 deaths every day. About 20%
42 (1,061) of worker fatalities in private industry in calendar year 2019 were in construction – accounting for
43 one in five worker deaths for the year.
44
45 The 5,333 fatal occupational injuries in 2019 represents the largest annual number since 2007.
46 Fatalities in the private construction industry increased 5 percent to 1,061– the largest total since 2007. A
47 worker died every 99 minutes from a work-related injury in 2019

13
14 Effectiveness of the OSHA Mandate
15
16 In more than four decades, OSHA and its state partners, coupled with the efforts of employers, safety and
17 health professionals, unions, and advocates, have had a dramatic effect on workplace safety.
18
19 Worker deaths in America are down on average, from about 38 worker deaths a day in 1970 to 15 a day
20 in 2019. Worker injuries and illnesses are down from 10.9 incidents per 100,000 full-time equivalent
21 workers in 1972 to 2.8 per 100,000 in 2019.
22
23 OSHA SAFETY STANDARDS - WHAT’S NEW?
24
25 The OSHA standards are contained in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) or written as “29
26 CFR.” OSHA provides standards for many industries; however, for this course we focus on the standards
27 relative to the construction industry, 29 CFR 1903, 1910, and primarily, 1926. These are the specific
28 OSHA standards that regulate and affect various types of work environments and activities:
29
30 • Part 1926: Construction is regulated by Part 1926 that affects new construction, major renovation work,
31 and demolition work.
32 • Part 1903: Part 1903 affects inspections, citations, and proposed penalties.
33 • Part 1904: Part 1904 affects recording and reporting occupational injuries and illness.
34 • Part 1910: Part 1910 affects general industry standards.
35
36 Each part is further subdivided into subparts that are organized alphabetically. Each clause starts with
37 1926 and is then divided into paragraph, then several sub-sub paragraphs. The typical example is
38 1926.453(a)(1)(i)[A]
39
40 Confined Spaces in Construction
41
42 New sections were added. This standard took effect in 2015.
43 Examples of locations where confined spaces may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:
44
45 • Air Preheaters  Air Receivers
46 • Boilers  Cesspools
47 • Chillers  Concrete pier columns
48 • Enclosed Beams  Heating, ventilation, and air
49 • Incinerators  conditioning (HVAC) ducts
50 • Lift Stations  Mixer Reactors
51 • Pits (such as elevator, escalator, pump, equipment)  Water mains
52 • Precast concrete and other preformed valve or other manhole units
53 • Tanks (such as fuel, chemical, water or other liquid, solid, or gas)
54 • VesselsFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 1 - Workplace Safety

1 Cranes and Derricks in Construction: 1926.1427
2
3 This is a new section. There is a great push to have the crane operators certified. The deadline now is
4 December of 2018. Those involved with the use of cranes and derricks, please review this section and
5 the requirements. 1926.1427 Cranes and Derricks in Construction Operator Qualifications Standard was
6 amended and was made effective on 7th Feb 2019.
7
8 Beryllium in Construction and Shipyards: 1926.1124
9
10 The most recent changes to the rules for Beryllium in Construction went into effect on 9/30/2020,
11 however, the standard has been updated several times since 2018, mostly for clarity and to better
12 align with adjacent rules in 29 CFR 1910 General Industry.
13
14 Residential Fall Protection
15
16 OSHA is emphasizing and bringing great awareness for the requirement for Crystalline Silica Rule:
17 Construction. Implementation date June 23, 2017, Enforcement September 23, 2017.
18
19 EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITY
20
21 This is a short summary of key employer responsibilities:
22 Please remember that the prime contractor assumes all obligations prescribed as employer.
23 • Provide a workplace free from serious recognized hazards and comply with standards, rules and
24 regulations issued under the OSH Act.
25 • Examine workplace conditions to make sure they conform to applicable OSHA standards.
26 • Make sure employees have and use safe tools and equipment and properly maintain this equipment.
27 • Use color codes, posters, labels, or signs to warn employees of potential hazards.
28 • Establish or update operating procedures and communicate them so that employees follow safety and
29 health requirements.
30 • Employers must provide safety training in a language and vocabulary workers can understand.
31 • Employers with hazardous chemicals in the workplace must develop and implement a written hazard
32 communication program and train employees on the hazards they are exposed to and proper precautions
33 (and a copy of safety data sheets must be readily available). See the OSHA page on Hazard
34 Communication.
35 • Provide medical examinations and training when required by OSHA standards.
36 • Post, at a prominent location within the workplace, the OSHA poster (or the state-plan equivalent)
37 informing employees of their rights and responsibilities.
38 • Keep records of work-related injuries and illnesses. (Note: Employers with ten or fewer employees and
39 employers in certain low-hazard industries are exempt from this requirement.
40 • Report to the nearest OSHA office all work-related fatalities within eight hours, and all work-related
41 inpatient hospitalizations, all amputations and all losses of an eye within 24 hours. Call the OSHA toll-free
42 number 1-800-321-OSHA (6742); TTY 1-877-889-5627. [Employers under federal OSHA's jurisdiction
43 were required to begin reporting by January 1, 2015. Establishments in a state with a state-run OSHA
44 program should contact their state plan for the implementation date].
45 • Provide employees, former employees and their representatives access to the Log of Work-Related
46 Injuries and Illnesses (OSHA Form 300). On February 1, and for three months, covered employers must
47 post the summary of the OSHA log of injuries and illnesses (OSHA Form 300A).
48 • Provide access to employee medical records and exposure records to employees or their authorized
49 representatives.
50 • Provide to the OSHA compliance officer the names of authorized employee representatives who may be
51 asked to accompany the compliance officer during an inspection.
52 • Not discriminate against employees who exercise their rights under the Act. See the OSHA
53 "Whistleblower Protection" webpage.
54 • Post OSHA citations at or near the work area involved. Each citation must remain posted until the
55 violation has been corrected, or for three working days, whichever is longer. Post abatement verification
56 documents or tags.
57 • Correct cited violations by the deadline set in the OSHA citation and submit required abatementChapter 1 - Workplace Safety Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle

3 OSHA encourages all employers to adopt an injury and illness prevention program. These programs,
4 known by a variety of names, are universal interventions that can substantially reduce the number and
5 severity of workplace injuries and alleviate the associated financial burdens on U.S. workplaces. Also,
6 numerous employers in the United States already manage safety using injury and illness prevention
7 programs, and we believe that all employers can and should do the same. Most successful programs are
8 based on a common set of key elements. These include management leadership, worker participation,
9 hazard identification, hazard prevention and control, education and training, and program evaluation and
10 improvement.
11
12 SAFETY PROGRAMS
13
14 A written safety program is a very useful and essential tool to follow all OSHA requirements. It can also
15 provide a discount in your workers’ compensation insurance premium. If you don’t have one, we suggest
16 that you implement one. In Florida, you can take advantage of the easily available toolkit from the
17 University of South Florida found at:
18 https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/cohpe/usfsafetyflorida/our-online-applications/safetywriter
19
20 Also, we suggest that you buy an OSHA book for each of your supervisors as part of their hiring process
21 and make it mandatory. You will surely see the difference.
22
23 Important topics to include in a safety program are:
24
25 • Control and prevention hazards  Emergency response plans
26 • First and CPR trained personnel  Goals and objectives of the program
27 • Identification of potential hazards on the jobsite  Inspections, training, accident reporting and
28 investigation
29 • Job hazard assessment  Management commitment
30 • Personal protective equipment  Policies and procedures
31 • Record keeping  Safety & health training, employee orientation
32 • Unit safety responsibilities
33 • Vehicle safety and use
34
35 Advantages of a safety program include:
36
37 • Insurance Savings  Savings in lost time and productivity due to accidents
38 • Good management tool to assure compliance
39 • Enhancement of workers’ safety awareness
40 TOP 10 CITED STANDARDS

6 suggest that you take the time to watch them. https://www.osha.gov/vtools/construction
7
8 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE RESIDENTIAL FALL PROTECTION
9 POLICY
10 Fall is the major cause of injuries in construction. It is important that we review the requirements for
11 residential construction where, most of the time, supervision is minimal or missing.
12
13 Under the new directive, employers must follow 1926.501(b)(13). This rule states that, “… Each employee
14 engaged in residential construction activities 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected
15 by guardrail systems, safety net system, or personal fall arrest system …” or, by alternative fall protection
16 measures allowed under 1926.501(b) for particular types of work as outlined below:
17
18 • 1926.501(b)(2)(ii): Controlled access zones and control lines can be used for some leading-edge
19 applications.
20 • 1926.501(b)(4)(i) and (ii): Covers can be used to prevent workers from falling through holes.
21 • 1926.501(b)(5): Positioning devices can be used while working on the face of formwork or reinforcing
22 steel.
23 • 1926.501(b)(7)(i) and (ii): Barricades, fences and covers can be used to prevent workers from falling into
24 excavations.
25 • 1926.501(b)(8)(i): Equipment guards can be used to prevent workers from falling into dangerous
26 equipment.
27 • 1926.501(b)(10): A combination of a warning line system and safety monitoring system can be used for
28 roofing work on low-slope (4:12 or less) roofs. Or, on roofs 50-feet (15.25 m) or less in width, the use of a
29 safety monitoring system without a warning line system is permitted.
30
31 If the employer can demonstrate that it is infeasible or creates a greater hazard to use the required fall
32 protection systems, the employer must instead develop and implement a written site-specific fall
33 protection plan in accordance with 1926.502(k). OSHA does not consider "economic infeasibility" to be
34 a basis for failing to provide conventional fall protection.
35
36 Note: There is a presumption that it is feasible and will not create a greater hazard to implement at
37 least one of the fall protection systems listed in 1926.501(b)(13).
38
39 OSHA expects that the fall protection methods listed in 1926.501(b)(13) can be used without
40 significant safety or feasibility problems for the vast majority of residential construction activities.
41
42 OSHA did not define residential construction in 1926.501(b)(13). STD 03-11-002 includes an
43 interpretation for the term “residential construction” for purposes of the standard.
44Chapter 1 - Workplace Safety Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle

1 Residential Construction Definition
2
3 In order to be classified as residential construction, two of the following elements must be met:
4 • The end-use of the structure being built must be as a home, i.e., a dwelling.
5 • The structure being built must be constructed using traditional wood frame construction materials and
6 methods.
7 • The limited use of steel I-beams to help support wood framing does not disqualify a structure from being
8 considered residential construction.
9 • The use of masonry brick or block in exterior walls are treated as falling within the scope of traditional
10 wood frame construction materials and methods.
11 • Cold-formed metal studs will be considered within the bounds of traditional wood frame construction
12 materials and methods.
13
14 Residential Training Requirements
15
16 Under 1926.503, workers exposed to fall hazards must be trained to recognize potential fall hazards
17 and, in the procedures to be followed, to minimize those hazards.
18
19 Training must cover the following among other subjects:
20
21 • The nature of fall hazards in the work area
22 • How to erect, maintain, disassemble, and inspect the fall protection systems to be used
23 • How to use and operate the fall protection systems to be used
24 • Subpart M requirements
25 • Supplements 1926.21
26 • Prepare training certification.
27 • Documentation of the latest training certification must be maintained.
28
29 Retraining for the following:
30
31 • Changes in the fall protection systems to be used or to the workplace
32 • Inadequacies in employee’s knowledge or use of fall protection indicates that retraining is necessary
33
34 RESIDENTIAL CONVENTIONAL FALL PROTECTION SYSTEMS
35
36 The following residential fall systems are outlined below.
37
38 • Guardrail systems
39 • Safety net systems
40 • Personal fall arrest systems
41
42 Residential Guardrail Systems
43
44 Brackets for engineered guardrail systems can either be side mounted or deck mounted. Either way,
45 employers should look to the manufacturer instructions or the recommendations of a registered
46 professional engineer for proper installation.
47
48 Residential Safety Net Systems
49
50 These nets have been positioned to prevent falls to the interior of the building. Employers should consult
51 the manufacturer’s instructions and/or a registered professional engineer to ensure proper installation of
52 the net and bracing of the stud walls. Give due consideration to the potential impact load on the net and
53 lateral load on the stud walls in the event of a fall. [1926.402(c)].Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 1 - Workplace Safety
Reicon Publishing, LLC 7
1 Residential Personal Fall Arrest Systems
2
3 • Anchor point: Anchorages used for attachment of Personal Fall Arrest equipment must be
4 capable of supporting at least 5,000 pounds per employee attached, or must be designed and
5 used as follows:
6 o As part of a complete personal fall arrest system which maintains a safety factor of at least
7 two.
8 o Under the supervision of a qualified person.
9 o Employer should look to the manufacturer’s instructions or the recommendations of a
10 registered professional engineer for proper installation. [1926.502(d)15)]
11
12 • Residential PFAS full body harness: A full body harness distributes the force of the fall over the
13 thighs, pelvis, waist, chest, and shoulders.
14 o Body belts have not been allowed as part of an arrest system since January 1998.
15 o Residential PFAS Full Body Harness-Connector/Lanyard
16 o Snap hooks must be locking type. [1926.502(d)(5)]
17 o Never hook two snap hooks together unless designed for that purpose. [1926.502(d)(6)]
18
19 • Residential personal fall restraint system: Although the standard does not mention personal
20 fall restraint systems, OSHA has previously stated that it accepts a properly utilized fall restraint
21 system in lieu of a personal fall arrest system when the restraint system is rigged in such a way
22 that prevents the worker from being exposed to the fall hazard.
23 o Fall restraint can be a body belt or full body harness.
24 o Must be tied off so that the worker cannot go past the unprotected side or edge, no matter
25 where the work is on the walking/working surface.
26 o Lanyards should be adjustable to take up slack when workers move about.
27
28 • Residential fall protection program - Other methods:
29 o Employers also have the option of having workers work from scaffolds (in compliance with
30 Subpart L), ladders (in compliance with Subpart X) or aerial lifts (in compliance with
31 1926.453) instead of complying with 1926.501(b)(13).
32 o Now we all know the first principle of mishap prevention is to “eliminate” the hazard whenever
33 possible. If you can’t eliminate it, you then have to minimize its effect. We cannot eliminate
34 working at heights in construction, but using ladders, scaffolds and aerial lifts can help
35 employers eliminate some falls from six feet or higher.
36 o Working at heights cannot be eliminated, but there are ways to minimize exposure to falls.
37 Assemble as many parts of the building as possible on the ground.
38 ▪ Properly assembled and braced IAW the manufacturer’s instruction and the
39 BCSI guide
40 ▪ Flying pre-assembled structures into place will minimize worker exposure to fall
41 hazards
42 ▪ Do as many things on the ground as possible
43 ▪ Some contractors are even pre-positioning portions of the guardrail system on
44 the ground
45 ▪ Pre-installed fall protection
46
47 Residential Fall Hazards - Prevention
48
49 Fall Protection Plan
50
51 If an employer can demonstrate that conventional fall protection is infeasible or presents a greater
52 hazard, the employer shall develop and implement a fall protection plan that complies with 1926.502(k).
53 The employer bears the burden of establishing that it is appropriate to implement a fall protection plan for
54 a particular workplace situation. [1926.502(k)]
55
56 The fall protection plan must meet all of the following requirements.
57 • The plan must be written.
58 • The plan must be site-specific.Chapter 1 - Workplace Safety Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
8 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 • A written fall protection plan developed for repetitive use, e.g., for a particular style or model of home, will
2 be considered site-specific with respect to a particular site only if it fully addresses all issues related to fall
3 protection at that site. Therefore, a standardized plan will have to be reviewed and revised as necessary,
4 on a site-by-site basis.
5 • The plan must be prepared by a “qualified person.” [1926.502(k)(1)]
6 • It must be developed specifically for the site where the residential construction work is being performed.
7 [1926.502(k)(1)]
8 • It must be maintained up to date. [1926.502(k)(1)]
9 • All changes must be approved by a qualified person. [1926.502(k)(2)]
10 • It must be maintained on the site. [1926.502(k)(3)]
11 • It must be implemented under the supervision of a competent person. [1926.502(k)(4)]
12 • The plan must include documentation of reasons why conventional fall protection systems are infeasible
13 or create a greater hazard. [1926.502(k)(5)]
14 • The plan must include a written discussion of the alternative work practices to be used that will eliminate
15 or reduce the possibility of a fall. [1926.502(k)(6)]
16 • It must identify each location where conventional fall protection systems cannot be used and designate
17 them as controlled access zones (CAZ). [1926.502(k)(7)]
18 • The plan must implement a safety monitoring system in conformance with 1926.502(h) where no other
19 alternative measure has been implemented. [1926.502(k)(8)]
20 • It must identify all workers designated to work in the CAZ. [1926.502(k)(9)]
21 • It must be reviewed and updated as appropriate if a fall, or near miss, occurs. [1926.502(k)(10)]

27 CRYSTALLINE SILICA CONSTRUCTION
28
29 In 1938, the Department of Labor produced a film titled "Stop Silicosis." Secretary Frances Perkins
30 concluded that silica dust was dangerous, but it can be prevented.
31
32 Silicosis is a form of occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust. It is marked
33 by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. It is a type of
34 pneumoconiosis.
35
36 The total deaths in the US due to Silicosis during the period between 2005 through 2014 was of 1,167
37 deaths, mortality rate is down from a high of 161 in 2005 to 84 deaths in 2014.
38
39 Those that were exposed didn't know then, and many still don't know now. For additional information,
40 view this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAByIIzQSuU
41
42
43 About 1.85 million workers are currently exposed to respirable crystalline silica in construction
44 workplaces. Over 640,000 of these workers are estimated to be exposed to silica levels that exceed
45 OSHA's proposed permissible exposure limit (PEL).
46
47 These exposures occur during common construction operations, such as:
48 • Drywall finishing using silica containingFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 1 - Workplace Safety
Reicon Publishing, LLC 9
1 • Operating vehicle-mounted drilling rigs material
2 • Rock Crushing
3 • Tuck pointing
4 • Using hand operated grinders
5 • Using Heavy equipment during earthmoving
6 • Using masonry saws
7 • Using jackhammers
8 • Using rotary hammers or drills
9
10 A proposed rule for new silica construction provisions is expected to save nearly 700 lives and prevent
11 1,600 new cases of silicosis per year once the full effects of the rule are realized.
12
13 Major Provisions of the New Silica Construction Standard
14
15 The new standard for silica construction that went into effect on September 23, 2017, includes provisions
16 for employers to do the following:
17 • Measure the amount of silica that workers are exposed to if it may be at or above an action level of 25
18 μg/m3 (micrograms of silica per cubic meter of air), averaged over an eight-hour day
19 • Protect workers from respirable crystalline silica exposures above the PEL of 50 μg/m3, averaged over an
20 eight-hour day
21 • Limit workers' access to areas where they could be exposed above the PEL
22 • Use dust controls to protect workers from silica exposures above the PEL
23 • Provide respirators to workers when dust controls cannot limit exposures to the PEL
24 • Offer medical exams, including chest X-rays and lung function tests every three years for workers
25 exposed above the PEL for 30 or more days per year
26 • Train workers on work operations that result in silica exposure and ways to limit exposure
27 • Keep records of workers' silica exposure and medical exams [1926.1153]
28
29 How to Control the Exposure?
30
31 Employers must use engineering controls and work practices as the primary way to keep exposures at or
32 below the PEL. Engineering controls include wetting down work operations or using local exhaust
33 ventilation (such as vacuums) to keep silica-containing dust out of the air and out of workers' lungs.
34 Another control method that may work well is enclosing an operation or "process isolation.” Respirators
35 are only allowed when engineering and work practice controls cannot maintain exposures at or below the
36 PEL.
37
38 For construction, the standard includes Table 1, a list of common construction tasks along with exposure
39 control methods and work practices that work well for those tasks and can be used to comply with the
40 requirements of the standard.
41
42 Please review the Table at the end of this section for the different ways in which to control exposure.
43
44 Regardless of which exposure control method is used, all construction employers covered by the
45 standard are required to do the following:
46
47 Establish and implement a written exposure control plan that identifies tasks that involve exposure and
48 methods used to protect workers, including procedures to restrict access to work areas where high
49 exposures may occur
50
51 Designate a competent person to implement the written exposure control plan
52 Restrict housekeeping practices that expose workers to silica where feasible alternatives are available
53 Offer medical exams, including chest X-rays and lung function tests every three years for workers who
54 are required by the standard to wear a respirator for 30 or more days per year
55 Train workers on work operations that result in silica exposure and ways to limit exposure
56 Keep records of workers’ silica exposure and medical exams

5 OSHA Directives: Inspection Procedures for the Respirable
6 Crystalline Silica Standards
7
8 New effective date: 06/25/2020 – The purpose of this Instruction is to provide guidelines and establish
9 uniform inspection and enforcement procedures for the respirable crystalline silica standards. The two
10 silica standards, 29 CFR 1910.1053 (General Industry and Maritime) and 29 DFR 1926.1153
11 (Construction), published in the Federal Register/ Vol. 81 No. 58/ Friday March 25, 2016, became
12 effective on June 23, 2016.
13
14 Significant Changes. This Instruction outlines the changes in enforcement due to the publication of the
15 silica standards in the Federal Register, 81 FR at 16285 (Mar. 25, 2016). The silica standards establish a
16 PEL of 50 µg/m³ and an action level (AL) of 25 µg/m³ for the three major forms of crystalline silica (i.e.,
17 quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite1 ) for the general, maritime, and construction industries.
18
19 The new PEL represents a change from the preceding PELs, which were based on formulas and were
20 inconsistent between industries and forms of silica. This change is particularly significant with regard to
21 the preceding PEL for the construction and shipyard industries, which was based on a particle count
22 method, expressed in terms of millions of particles per cubic foot (mppcf), and required the use of a
23 conversion factor to yield results reported in mg/m³.

16 OVERVIEW HISTORY
17
18 USA
19
20 10th Century B.C. - Kings and Temples and Book of Genesis, first possible indication of a form of
21 workman's compensation
22
23 1855 - Georgia, passed the Employer Liability Act in the state legislature.
24
25 1855-1907 - 26 other states passed similar acts that simply gave permission to sue the employer if the
26 employee proved a negligent act or omission.
27
28 1897 - England repealed the Employer's Liability Act and replaced it with a Working Man’s Compensation
29 Act.
30
31 1898 - New York, the New York Social Club drafted a bill for the Partial Compensation for Workers. No
32 action was taken by the state legislature. The largest opponent was the labor unions.
33
34 1901 - Maryland passed legislation for a Cooperative Accident Insurance Fund.
35
36 1905 - The Maryland Act was ruled as unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court.
37
38 1908 - The Federal Employer's Liability Act was passed by the U.S. Congress at the urging of President
39 Theodore Roosevelt. This was the first workman’s compensation law in the U.S.
40
41 1911 - New York, Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire happened. Over 146 workers jumped to their deaths
42 to escape the fire in the ten-story building because the exits were blocked. This resulted in many lawsuits.
43 The entire nation was shocked by the tragedy. New York City immediately adopted the first safety codes.
44
45 1911 - Wisconsin became the first state to adopt a true workman's compensation law. It was called the
46 Great Trade Off. Employers provided coverage; employees gave up the right to sue.
47
48 1912 - Four more states passed laws.
49
50 1913 - Eight more states adopted legislation.
51
52 1915 - Alaska and Hawaii passed workman’s compensation laws even though they were only territories.Chapter 2 - Workers’ Compensation Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
14 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1
2 1935 - Florida passed the Workman's Compensation Law.
3
4 Florida
5
6 1935 - Florida’s Workman’s Compensation Law became effective.
7
8 1978 -1979 - Major changes in the state workers’ compensation system were underway in the state
9 legislature, the first major change since 1935. The fixed benefit system was replaced, and the Wage Loss
10 Concept was introduced. Workman's compensation was changed to workers' compensation.
11
12 1990 - The Division of Fraud and the first Drug Free Workplace were established.
13
14 Later - The Bureau of Safety was introduced. Managed health care, employee assistance office, and
15 emphasis on reemployment was introduced.
16
17 1993 - Wage loss was eliminated. Supplemental benefits, managed care, chiropractic care limits, and the
18 ombudsman office were created.
19
20 1999 - The special disability trust fund and division of safety were abolished.
21
22 2003 - The Department of Insurance and Banking merged to become the Department of Financial
23 Services.
24
25 The closing years of the 20th Century brought many changes especially as litigation and medical care
26 continued to be a problem not only in Florida, but throughout the nation as well.
27
28 Since that time, the law has undergone some drastic changes to adapt to all of the other changes that
29 have taken place in our society reflected by the numerous laws enacted by both the US and state
30 legislatures.
31
32 Legislative Intent
33
34 To assure the quick and efficient delivery of disability and medical benefits to an injured worker, an
35 efficient and self-executing system must be created that is not an economic or administrative burden.
36
37 To facilitate the worker’s return to gainful reemployment at a reasonable cost to the employer.
38
39 The Florida workers’ compensation system is based on a mutual renunciation of common-law rights and
40 defenses by employers and employees alike.
41
42 Workers’ compensation is a no-fault system meant to protect workers and employers. The idea of
43 workers’ compensation was to prevent employees from instituting private lawsuits against employers
44 based on common law. In exchange for providing those benefits, employers generally cannot be sued in
45 the court for causing injuries.
46
47 The Future …
48 We are just a few years into the 21st Century and have already seen sweeping changes with the
49 abolishment of the Department of Labor and Employment Security, the Division of Safety, and the Special
50 Disability Trust Fund. We saw many departments merging, created, and so on.
51 We saw the attorney-fee award structure, compliance, exemption, etc. introduced and modified to meet
52 the current needs.
53 Yes, there will be changes as we progress, but workers' compensation is still here for the citizens of
54 Florida.Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 2 - Workers’ Compensation

1 LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO F.S. 440
2
3 Changes in 2014
4
5 In 2014, changes were made to House Bill (HB) 271, F.S. 440.107, .15, .16, .49.
6
7 Businesses had five days to respond to the state’s request for records. That was changed to ten days.
8
9 Information related to an employer's stop-work order should be made available on the Division's website,
10 be updated daily, and remain on the website for at least five years.
11
12 The amount of time investigators could review a company’s records for not having enough workers’
13 compensation insurance was changed from three to two years.
14
15 The multiplier for penalties levied was increased from 1.5 to 2.
16
17 Wherever the percentage of “66 2/3rd %” was changed to “66.67%”
18
19 The requirements and deposits were revised in that the Department must calculate the assessment rate
20 for the Special Disability Trust Fund by July 1 of each year.
21
22 Changes now allow companies to make a down payment of just $1,000 on their fine, have payment
23 arrangements for the rest, and arrange for insurance coverage. This was to allow businesses to continue
24 to function while aligning themselves with the law. First time offenders may receive a credit for the initial
25 payment of the estimated annual workers' compensation policy premium, to be applied to the penalty.
26 The $1,000 penalty will be assessed against the employer even if the calculated penalty after the credit
27 has been applied is less than $1,000. This is true even if the coverage is through PEO. Failure by the
28 employer to pay the penalty in full or enter into a payment agreement with the Department within 28 days
29 after service of the stop-work order will result in immediate reinstatement of the stop-work order.
30
31 Changes in 2016
32
33 April 2016 - The Florida Supreme Court overturned a law that had previously limited attorney’s fees in
34 workers’ compensation court cases. It took the case regarding workers’ compensation attorney’s fees
35 when a Miami man won an $822.70 compensation after being injured while working for a door making
36 company. The man’s lawyer, who spent 107 hours on the case, sought a fee of nearly $37,000, but was
37 only awarded $164. The dramatic difference occurred because at the time Florida only allowed attorneys
38 representing injured workers to be paid 20% of the first $5,000 in benefits received, and 15% of the next
39 $5,000.
40
41 April 2016 - The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) approved a statewide workers’
42 compensation insurance rate increase of 14.5% for businesses. The increase was to take effect on
43 December 1, 2016, to affect 2017.
44
45 Currently, temporary disability benefits limit the length of time disability payments can be received for a
46 single injury to two years (104 weeks). In a recent case, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that this two-
47 year cap is unconstitutional and increased it to a five-year cap (270 weeks).

6 Employee Leasing Option
7
8 You, as an employer, may also consider leasing employees from a professional employer organization or
9 (PEO). In this circumstance, the PEO becomes the employer and provides workers’ compensation
10 coverage to each employee who is paid by the leasing PEO. This is a civil contract.
11
12 If you enter into an employee leasing agreement with a licensed employee leasing company, the
13 agreement should include workers’ compensation coverage only for employees listed with the employee
14 leasing company. You would be responsible for workers’ compensation coverage for all non-leased
15 employees.
16
17 The payroll for all leased employees must be paid through the leasing company. Any changes in job
18 duties or status of an employee must be reported to the leasing company promptly.
19
20 Advantages
21 • Your rates will not be affected because you are new in business or have claims.
22 • No headaches of quarterly reporting and worrying about premiums.
23
24 Disadvantages
25
26 Cannot hire direct laborers or workers for a short period of time.
27 Have to be very particular in sending the details of every worker and the job classifications.
28 Difficult to change the classification of the workers working in different classifications.
29 Complex situation and liability if one of your sub-contractor’s workers is not covered under the sub-
30 contractor’s insurance.
31 Individual Self-Insurers
32
33 An employer may become individually self-insured and secure the payment of workers’ compensation by
34 providing proof of financial strength necessary to ensure timely payments of current and future claims.
35
36 Authorization and regulation of individual self-insurers is through the Division. [F.S. 440.38]
37
38 Commercial Self-Insurance Funds
39
40 A group of persons may form a commercial self-insurance fund for purposes of pooling and spreading
41 liabilities for any commercial and/or casualty insurance.
42
43 Authorization and regulation of commercial self-insurance funds is through the Office of Insurance
44 Regulation. [F.S. 624.462]

46 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION EXEMPTION
47
48 An individual who meets the eligibility requirements to obtain an exemption pursuant to F.S. 440.05 may
49 elect to be exempt. [F.S. 440.05]
50
51 Sole proprietors and individuals cannot be exempted.
52
53 The exempted individual may not receive workers’ compensation benefits when they sustain a work-
54 related injury.
55
56 The applicant must be listed as an officer of the corporation in the records of the Florida Department ofFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 2 - Workers’ Compensation

1 State, Division of Corporations. The corporation must be registered with the Division of Corporations in
2 Florida.
3
4 Certificates of election to be exempt shall apply only to the corporate officer named on the notice of
5 election to be exempt and apply only within the scope of the business or trade listed on the notice of
6 election to be exempt.
7
8 The applicant must own at least 10% of the corporation.
9
10 A $50 application fee is required.
11
12 No more than three officers of a corporation (including an LLC) or of any group of affiliated corporations
13 may elect to be exempt from this chapter. [F.S. 440.02(15)(b)(2)]
14
15 A construction industry certificate of exemption issued by the Division is valid for two years after the
16 effective date stated thereon.
17
18 Exemptions are effective on the date they are issued by the Division.

26 Contact customer service at 1-800-742-2214 for any further information.
27
28 An exemption is subject to revocation if the person named on the certificate does not meet eligibility
29 requirements for an exemption. One can voluntarily revoke an exemption by filling out Form DWC 250-R
30 Form DWC 250-R Notice of Revocation to be Exempt
31
32 Exemption Advantages/Disadvantages
33
34 It is important to know the advantages and disadvantages of a workers’ compensation exemption,
35 especially when you see the following statistics. There has been a rise, which is a good indication of
36 construction growth. The rise in non-construction exemptions is due to the statutory change that defines
37 non-construction limited liability company members as “corporate officers,” that allows them to get the
38 exemption.
39
40 We all know the biggest advantage of the exemption is the monetary benefit. It is important to know the
41 disadvantages of the exemption.
42
43 So, only the disadvantages are listed here:
44 • If you are injured, you are on your own.
45 • If you hired a sub-contractor with the exemption and they hired a day laborer on a cash-payment basis
46 who gets hurt, you are responsible.
47 • If anyone driving a company vehicle has an accident, the vehicle is covered under workers’
48 compensation, not the company’s automobile insurance.
49 • Think of a scenario where your sub-contractor submits the proof of insurance for insurance that is through
50 the PEO, but the worker who is injured was not reported to the PEO.

28 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION EMPLOYER’S FAQS
29
30 Here are the most common frequently asked questions (FAQs) from employers regarding the workers’
31 compensation system.
32
33 Q: Who can I contact with questions or concerns regarding risk classification codes and premium
34 amounts?
35 A: Call your insurance carrier or service representative. If you have a dispute regarding the risk
36 classification codes, contact the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) at (800) 622-
37 4123
38
39 Q: Does the injured worker pay any part of my workers' compensation insurance premium?
40 A: The law is very specific on this point. It is the employer’s responsibility to pay the entire premium for
41 workers' compensation insurance coverage.
42
43 Q: What kinds of employee injuries are covered?
44 A: The law covers all accidental injuries and occupational diseases arising out of and in the course and
45 scope of employment. This includes diseases or infections resulting from such injuries. The law also
46 covers death resulting from such injuries within specified periods of time. Even if you do not think an
47 injury is covered, you must still file the First Report of Injury or Illness (DWC-1) with your insurance
48 carrier within seven days of your first knowledge of the accident/injury for determination of
49 responsibility.
50
51 Q: What injuries are not covered?
52 A: The law does not provide compensation for the following conditions:
53 • A mental or nervous injury due to stress, fright, or excitement.
54 • A work-related condition that causes an employee to be afraid or dislike for another individual because of
55 the individual's race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap.
56 • "Pain and suffering" have never been compensable in Florida, nor is it compensable in any other state.
57 • The employer may not sue an injured worker for causing a catastrophe nor can the injured worker sue the
58 employer for their injury. This trade-off makes it possible for injured workers to receive immediate medicalFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 2 - Workers’ Compensation
Reicon Publishing, LLC 23
1 care, at no cost to the injured worker, without any consideration for who was at fault, the employer or the
2 employee. In civil law, negligence must be established through litigation before any compensation is
3 awarded. [F.S. 440.02(1)]
4
5 Q: Can an employer be liable for double compensation?
6 A: An employer can be liable for double compensation if a minor child is injured while employed in
7 violation of any of the conditions of the child labor laws of Florida. The employer alone, not the
8 insurance carrier, is liable for up to double the normal compensation as provided by the workers'
9 compensation law. To receive further information regarding the Child Labor Law, call the Child Labor
10 Office at (800) 226-2536.
11
12 Q: As a small business owner, can I be sued by an injured worker if I provide all the necessary care, light
13 duty work, and offer to retrain the employee?
14 A: Under the provisions of F.S. 440, an injured worker has two years from the date of the accident to file
15 a petition for benefits with the Division of Administrative Hearings. If an employer provides benefits and
16 return to work options, that should be sufficient to meet the ultimate goal of returning an injured worker
17 to gainful employment.
18
19 However, an employer/carrier's definition of "necessary care" and that of an injured worker may differ.
20 When that happens, the injured worker has no remedy except to file a petition for benefits and have a
21 judge of compensation claims determine whether the benefits that are being provided are sufficient, or if
22 additional benefits not being provided are required by Florida law. If the employer is providing benefits, all
23 expenditures must be reported to the employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier for statistical
24 purposes.
25
26 Q: What in the system would prevent an injured worker, who wanted to leave their employer anyway, from
27 claiming to be hurt, waiting out the treatment, still claiming to be hurt and then trying to settle?
28 A: By law, pain or other subjective complaints alone, in the absence of objective relevant medical
29 findings, are not compensable. However, sometimes these types of claims do occur, and they are
30 sometimes settled by insurance carriers for a nominal amount of money to rid the employer/carrier of a
31 nuisance case.
32
33 Q: Is compensation payable if an employee refuses to use a safety appliance like a hard hat, safety
34 goggles or observe a safety rule?
35 A: Compensation will still be paid, but indemnity benefits (partial wage replacement) may be reduced by
36 25% if the employee knew about the safety rule prior to the accident and failed to observe the rule, or
37 if the employee knowingly chooses not to use a safety appliance which the employer has directed him
38 to use. [F.S. 440.09(5))]
39
40 Q: Will becoming a drug-free workplace save me money on my workers’ compensation insurance
41 premium?
42 A: If you implement a drug-free workplace program in accordance with the criteria set forth in F.S.
43 440.102, you may be eligible for a 5% premium credit on your workers’ compensation insurance
44 premium. In addition to the premium credit, having a workers' compensation drug-free workplace
45 program may make your workplace safer, resulting in fewer accidents, which may reduce your
46 workers’ compensation costs.
47
48 Q: Under the workers’ compensation drug-free workplace program, can I conduct random drug testing of
49 my employees?
50 A: In addition to the situations in which testing is mandatory, the law does not prohibit a private employer
51 from conducting random testing or any other lawful testing of employees. A public employer may
52 institute random testing of employees in "safety sensitive" or "special risk" occupations.

SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PRACTICES

2 INTRODUCTION
3
4 Providing excellent services or making superior quality services are essential ingredients in a successful
5 business. However, these alone do not guarantee success; they must be coupled with good business
6 practices. Your company and you, as its leader, take pride in the workmanship delivered to your clients
7 on a daily basis.
8
9 Just knowing your trade skills is not sufficient to guarantee success in any business enterprise. There are
10 other things that need to be addressed by an entrepreneur, if you are part owner, supervisor, or if you are
11 part of the management.
12
13 Statistics reflect that the USA is the country where the largest quantity of new enterprises is formed every
14 year, and it is also the same place that records the most quantity of bankruptcy filings in the same period
15 of time. Usually, it is not because the individual running the company does not know their trade, but
16 because they do not know how to manage it.

37 SELF-ASSESSMENT
38
39 So, you have determined you want to be your own boss. Commendable, but before you take that
40 important step, there are several things you need to address.
41
42 Do I have What it Takes?
43
44 As previously noted, knowing your trade does not necessarily lead to the road to success.
45
46 Am I ready to take on the additional hours and worries that being an entrepreneur carries?
47
48 As a supervisor working for someone else, you know that you will have a paycheck at the end of the
49 week, but you do not have to worry about running the business, sales, collections, payments to
50 employees, and suppliers.
51
52 But, as an entrepreneur, you will find that a great deal of your time will be spent in organizing andChapter 3 - Successful Business Practices Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle

1 directing the activities of the business and your employees. Unless you run your business organization as
2 well as you perform your field operations, you will find that everything is useless.
3
4 Personal audit: Undertake a personal audit or self-assessment to identify your strengths and
5 weaknesses.
6
7 Recognize your strengths and weaknesses: Work to recognize your strengths and address your
8 weaknesses. There is a great deal of help and assistance out there if you look.
9
10 Personal objectives: Recognize your reasons for becoming self-employed and be very clear about your
11 personal objectives and goals.
12
13 The duties of an effective manager include:

22 YOUR POTENTIAL AS AN ENTREPRENEUR
23
24 What is Entrepreneurship?
25
26 Entrepreneurship is the act of creating a business or businesses while building and scaling it to generate
27 a profit. However, as a basic entrepreneurship definition, it’s a bit limiting. The more modern
28 entrepreneurship definition is also about transforming the world by solving big problems. Like initiating
29 social change, creating an innovative product, or presenting a new life-changing solution.
30
31 What the entrepreneurship definition doesn’t tell you is that it is what people do to take their career and
32 dreams into their own hands and lead it in the direction of their own choice. It’s about building a life on
33 your own terms. No bosses. No restricting schedules. And no one holding you back.
34
35 Entrepreneurs can take the first step in making the world a better place, for everyone in it.
36
37 What is the Meaning of Entrepreneurship?
38
39 The meaning of entrepreneurship involves an entrepreneur who takes action to make a change in the
40 world. Whether startup entrepreneurs solve a problem that many struggles with each day, bring people
41 together in a way no one has before, or build something revolutionary that advances society, they all have
42 one thing in common - action.
43
44 It’s not some idea that’s stuck in your head. Entrepreneurs take the idea and execute it. Entrepreneurship
45 is about the execution of ideas.
46
47 Why Be an Entrepreneur?
48
49 Describe the rewards of going into business for yourself.

51 Describe the risks of going into business for yourself.

33 The Reason People Become Entrepreneurs
34
35 The Entrepreneurship Appeal
36
37 With over 400 million entrepreneurs, entrepreneurship has an international appeal. Every entrepreneur
38 has their own reason that drove them to dive into being their own boss. Whether entrepreneurs need
39 more freedom or to make the world a better place, they all take control of their life by living life on their
40 own terms.
41
42 Now that we have discussed the advantages, disadvantages, the personal traits of an entrepreneur, and
43 you feel that, if you are one, you have made the right decision, it is commendable.
44
45 PLANNING
46
47 Planning is anticipating and taking advantage of business opportunities and problems. Planning requires
48 a great deal of time that often seems to take away from pressing day-to-day problems.
49
50 Suppose your boss asks you to organize a blood donor campaign. Is the objective to get as much
51 donated as possible? Or is it to raise the company profile? Deciding the real objectives will help you plan
52 the project.
53
54 Once you have defined the scope and objectives of the project, get the stakeholders to review and agree
55 to them.
56

1 making choices that should only be made based on good information. It requires the owner/manager to
2 decide which people, resources, and budget are required to complete a project.
3
4 The steps in preparing a business plan are as follows:
5 • Define the scope and objectives
6 • Define the deliverable
7 • Determine a vision for the company
8 • Determine a vision for the leadership
9
10 Define the Scope and Objectives
11
12 First, understand the company objectives. Deciding the real objectives will help you plan your activities.
13 Scope defines the boundary of the company objectives. Deciding what is in or out of the scope will
14 determine the amount of work that needs to be performed.
15
16 Understand who the stakeholders are, what they expect to be delivered, and enlist their support.
17
18 Define the Deliverable
19
20 You must define the deliverable, in other words, what will be delivered by the company over time.
21
22 Decide what tangible things will be delivered and document them in enough detail to enable someone
23 else to produce them correctly and effectively.
24
25 Key stakeholders must review the definition of deliverable and must agree they accurately reflect what
26 must be delivered.
27
28 Determine a Vision for the Company
29
30 No mystery here. The number one priority is the need to have a vision for the company and its future. It’s
31 critical that you, as the owner, have some clarity about what sort of construction company you want your
32 company to be and where you see your position in the market.
33 Where do you see yourself and your company in the next year, five years, and ten years from now?
34 • What are your expansion goals?
35 • What will your personal and company positions be in the local market in the future?
36 • What are your needs, now, and in the future in regard to capital and labor sources?
37
38 All of these and similar questions should be addressed in your business plan. If you are to be the captain
39 of your ship, it is wise to plan your course before you leave the homeport.
40
41 Determine a Vision for Leadership
42
43 A close runner-up as a priority to the vision for the company is the vision for leadership that contractors
44 must have. As a contractor grows in size, they realize that they cannot be all things to all people or be
45 everywhere they need to be at the same time. Therefore, having the best field leaders leading the daily
46 charge in the field is crucial for a successful contractor.
47
48 Create a Sense of Urgency … Not Emergency
49
50 Emergency-based contractors wear out and lose employees. Having a sense of urgency in your company
51 actually inspires and energizes workers.
52
53 Creating a sense of urgency begins with you, the owner, communicating what your expectations are,
54 sharing the highs and lows of the company with your workers, and informing workers as to what your
55 customers want and expect from their performance.
56
57 Work on your leadership skills and make sure you understand the difference between leadership and
58 management. Good employees want to be led, not supervised.

1 KNOW THE REGULATIONS AFFECTING YOUR INDUSTRY
2
3 F.S. 489 provides for the licensure and regulation of all types of contractors in Florida. It is divided into
4 three parts:
5 • Construction Contracting
6 • Electrical and Alarm System Contracting
7 • Septic Tank Contracting.
8
9 Another statute, F.S. 713, is the Florida Lien Law.
10
11 We will start the discussion of this topic of regulations affecting our industry by mentioning the necessary
12 disclosures affecting contracts. Both of these statutes contain provisions that mandate certain disclosures
13 or statements that must be included in construction contracts.
14
15 Some of the regulations governing our industry impact our contracts.
16
17 Contracts that Comply with State Law
18
19 You should have a copy of F.S. 489 on hand at your place of business. You can view a copy by visiting:
20 leg.state.fl.us/statutes/
21
22 The Florida Statutes contain provisions that mandate certain disclosures or statements that MUST be
23 included in construction contracts. Some of these provisions have dollar amount thresholds. Some
24 provisions must be included in each and every contract. Are there any that you are not familiar with?
25
26 The goal here is to orient your contracts so that they are consistent with state law. It includes operating
27 within the scope of your license and providing reasonable processes for dispute resolution. This includes
28 proper disclosures, such as the recovery fund disclosure in F.S. 489 and the lien law disclosure in F.S.
29 713. It also includes compliance with requirements outside the license law, such as the construction
30 defects law in F.S. 558.
31
32 Let us look more closely at each of these objectives
33
34 Basic Elements of a Contract
35
36 Writing contracts with the public that comply with state law should include the following elements:
37 • Scope of work
38 • Time frame
39 • Price
40 • Process for changes to the work
41 • Process for close out and final completion
42 • Successful business practices
43
44 These are the basic elements in a construction contract. Contracts are one of the most important
45 documents in a business. A poorly written contract between contractor and owner could be detrimental to
46 the business if these terms and others mandated by the statutes are not included in this document. The
47 absence of some of these disclosures may render your contract null in a court of law. The same attention
48 should be given to subcontracts between your company and a prime contractor.

50 Duty of Contractor to Notify Residential Property Owner of Recovery Fund [F.S.
51 489.1425]
52
53 Each agreement or contract for repair, restoration, improvement, or construction to residential real
54 property must contain a written statement explaining the consumer’s right under the recovery fund, except
55 where the value of all labor and materials does not exceed $2,500. The written statement must be
56 substantially in the following form:

10
11 Any direct contract greater than $2,500 between an owner and a contractor, related to improvements to
12 real property consisting of single or multiple family dwellings up to and including four units, must contain
13 the following notice provision printed in no less than 12-point, capitalized, boldfaced type on the front
14 page of the contract or on a separate page, signed by the owner and dated:
15
16 ACCORDING TO FLORIDA'S CONSTRUCTION LIEN LAW (F.S. 713.001-713.37), THOSE WHO WORK
17 ON YOUR PROPERTY OR PROVIDE MATERIALS AND SERVICES AND ARE NOT PAID IN FULL
18 HAVE A RIGHT TO ENFORCE THEIR CLAIM FOR PAYMENT AGAINST YOUR PROPERTY, THIS
19 CLAIM IS KNOWN AS A CONSTRUCTION LIEN. IF YOUR CONTRACTOR OR A SUBCONTRACTOR
20 FAILS TO PAY SUBCONTRACTORS, SUB-SUBCONTRACTORS, OR MATERIAL SUPPLIERS, THOSE
21 PEOPLE WHO ARE OWED MONEY MAY LOOK TO YOUR PROPERTY FOR PAYMENT, EVEN IF
22 YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID YOUR CONTRACTOR IN FULL. IF YOU FAIL TO PAY YOUR
23 CONTRACTOR, YOUR CONTRACTOR MAY ALSO HAVE A LIEN ON YOUR PROPERTY
24
25 THIS MEANS IF A LIEN IS FILED YOUR PROPERTY COULD BE SOLD AGAINST YOUR WILL TO PAY
26 FOR LABOR, MATERIALS, OR OTHER SERVICES THAT YOUR CONTRACTOR OR A
27 SUBCONTRACTOR MAY HAVE FAILED TO PAY. TO PROTECT YOURSELF, YOU SHOULD
28 STIPULATE IN THIS CONTRACT THAT BEFORE ANY PAYMENT IS MADE, YOUR CONTRACTOR IS
29 REQUIRED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A WRITTEN RELEASE OF LIEN FROM ANY PERSON OR
30 COMPANY THAT HAS PROVIDED TO YOU A “NOTICE TO OWNER.” FLORIDA’S CONSTRUCTION
31 LIEN LAW IS COMPLEX, AND IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU CONSULT AN ATTORNEY.
32
33 Since the goal of F.S. 489 is to protect the public, actions that clarify relationships, actions that comply
34 with licensing requirements, and actions that advance safety and wellbeing would all be regulatory
35 measures.
36
37 As a contractor, you must be aware of the following statutes in order to stay in compliance with the law.
38
39 Disciplinary Proceedings [F.S. 489.129]
40
41 Committing mismanagement or misconduct in the practice of contracting that causes financial harm to a
42 customer. Financial mismanagement or misconduct occurs when:
43
44 Valid liens have been recorded against the property of a contractor’s customer for supplies or services
45 ordered by the contract for the customer’s job; the contractor has received funds from the customer to
46 pay for the supplies or services; and the contractor has not had the liens removed from the property, by
47 payment or by bond, within 75 days after the date of such liens;
48
49 The contractor has abandoned a customer’s job and the percentage of completion is less than the
50 percentage of the total contract price paid to the contractor as of the time of abandonment, unless the
51 contractor is entitled to retain such funds under the terms of the contract or refunds the excess funds
52 within 30 days after the date the job is abandoned; or
53
54 The contractor’s job has been completed, and it is shown that the customer has had to pay more for the
55 contracted job than the original contract price, as adjusted for subsequent change orders, unless such
56 increase in cost was the result of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor, was the result of
57 circumstances caused by the customer, or was otherwise permitted by the terms of the contract between
58 the contractor and the customer.

5 • Start the work within 90 days of receiving the permits, and
6 • Continue through timely completion

8 Notice of Commencement [F.S. 713]
9 The wording for the Notice of Commencement has been amended:
10
11 “Warning to owner: any payments made by the owner after the expiration of the Notice of
12 Commencement are considered improper payments under Chapter 713…”
13
14 The preparation, filing, and posting of the Notice of Commencement are the owner’s responsibility or the
15 lending institution if there is a construction loan in the project, it never is the contractor’s responsibility.
16
17 The document must be posted at the jobsite, and that is also the owner’s responsibility.
18
19 On the permit card, the “Warning to Owner” print size has been reduced to 14-point, capitalized,
20 boldfaced type.
21
22 The sentence, “A Notice of Commencement must be recorded and posted on the job site before the first
23 inspection.” has been added to the Warning to Owner language.
24
25 If the project has a value of $2,500 or more, the NOC must be posted at the jobsite prior to calling for the
26 first building inspection.
27
28 SURROUND YOURSELF WITH A GOOD TEAM
29
30 You cannot do it all; no matter how much you try. Find the right people with the right skills and
31 personalities to be part of your team.
32
33 You are not the Energizer Bunny! Make sure you have a plan for recharging your batteries and keeping
34 up the motivation, you will need to make your dream business happen.
35
36 When you become self-employed, you become responsible for designing, producing, selling, customer
37 care, financing, collecting bad debts, bookkeeping, etc. But it is not essential that you undertake all of
38 these tasks unaided. It may be more cost-effective to allow professional and experienced people in
39 particular sectors to assume some ‘chores’ with which you are not comfortable and thus allow you the
40 time to undertake those with which you are, paying for their work from the increased turnover you are now
41 capable of earning.
42
43 Good practices to develop a good team of workers for your company include:
44 • Provide on-going education and training for workers
45 • Cross-train workers to build bench strength
46 • Communicate the direction and goals daily
47 • Create a work culture that enjoys and laughs
48 • Institute a meaningful incentive planChapter 3 - Successful Business Practices Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
34 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 Provide On-Going Education and Training for Workers
2
3 “On-going” suggests a continuous effort to train whenever they can.
4
5 For the seasonal contractor, this might mean bringing their workers in a few days to a few weeks earlier
6 than opening day and taking them through a series of training topics.
7
8 Every contractor should be ready for those rainy days when grabbing an extra few hours on some
9 education would benefit the crews.
10
11 You are taking this course not only to comply with the continuing education requirements of your license,
12 but also to learn about new changes in the statutes, building codes, etc. affecting your license. Your
13 workers deserve the same consideration. On-going training and education on safety, new methods of
14 doing things, seminars conducted by speakers who will discuss these topics, will be most beneficial not
15 only to your employees but also to your company.
16
17 Cross-Train to Build Bench Strength
18
19 The greater diversity that your workers can handle, the easier time of scheduling you will experience.
20 Having more than one worker who can competently handle a paver, sealcoat machine, roller, or backhoe,
21 for example, the better chance your productivity will stay strong and profitable. This certainly is one of
22 signs of a successful construction contractor. Having workers who are able to step up and do additional
23 tasks is one of the necessities of a well-run organization.
24
25 We cannot be at the mercy of one of our essential employees getting sick or quitting, and now we have
26 become an emergency contractor again either having to shut down operations or hiring someone in a
27 hurry at exorbitant costs to the organization.
28
29 Communicate the Direction and Goals Daily
30
31 There is simply no excuse for not holding daily meetings with your crews.
32
33 Call them crew huddles or tailgate meetings but do them - daily! And set goals for the project, the day, or
34 the week -- whatever makes the most sense for your company and workers -- but setting targets always
35 comes back to inspire and refocus your workers.
36 This is another practice that will reap benefits for your organization, it has been proven numerous times
37 that employees seek a sense of belonging and participating in the company decisions more than an
38 increase in pay.
39
40 Create a Work Culture that Enjoys and Laughs
41
42 The most successful contractors, of any size, are all construction companies that enjoy people, celebrate
43 successes, and laugh a lot. The people at these organizations, from the owner to the lowest-paid laborer,
44 are just plain fun to hang out with. You can see the good-natured ribbing the workers dish out to their
45 foreman and, especially, to the owner.
46
47 You can keep people a long time with you if they enjoy you, the company culture, and are allowed to
48 laugh a little. A good supervisor is not afraid of laughing with and sharing good moments with their
49 employees. You as one of those type of supervisors, should be familiar with every one of your
50 employees, call them by their first names, ask them about their family and kids.
51
52 Remember, employees are looking for a feeling of belonging!
53
54 Institute a Meaningful Incentive Plan
55
56 OK, we finally see money showing up. Sure, money is important and the contractor who can creatively
57 reward performance with good pay and some form of bonus money will keep better workers around
58 longer.
59Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 3 - Successful Business Practices
Reicon Publishing, LLC 35
1 There are a multitude of incentive-based compensation approaches, and they can be overly simple to
2 more complicated. Whatever path you follow, just be sure that your workers understand what it takes to
3 make that extra dollar. Yes, pay them what they are worth. Evaluate each one of them and give them the
4 rewards they deserve.
5
6 Personal evaluation of an employee is possibly one of the best tools a supervisor possesses to
7 communicate with them. Do not reward borderline employees, evaluate them, and be honest with them
8 then you will see that the majority of them change their attitudes and work habits. Some others will leave,
9 but then you are possibly lucky they left, and you did not have to fire them.
10
11 The most favored performance bonus is for gains made above what was set as a goal.
12
13 ASSESS YOUR PRODUCTS/SERVICES
14
15 Are you confident that your product is of a high quality in design and production?
16
17 Are you confident that there is a market for it?
18
19 Are you confident that your potential customers will pay the price you calculate necessary to meet your
20 costs?
21
22 These are some of the questions a contractor should ask about the company products and services.
23 Superior quality, timely production, and customer satisfaction are the qualities a successful contractor
24 must possess. A reputable contractor will be recognized in the industry and will be allowed, at times, to
25 obtain projects where their bid is not the lowest among the other bidders.
26
27 Measuring Construction Quality
28
29 Measuring quality is essential to improvement. With measurements, you can see trends, problem areas,
30 and gains made through improvement efforts.
31
32 KNOW YOUR MARKET AND COMPETITORS
33
34 One of the first questions people ask about a new idea or venture is, “Who is the competition?” Who else
35 is doing this? The worst rookie mistake in the world is to answer, “No one.”
36
37 There is always a competitor. Even if you cannot find anyone else who is doing what you are doing,
38 someone probably is thinking about it. And even if nobody is thinking about it, you’ll always have indirect
39 competitors, including the status quo and your customers’ thrift.
40
41 As an entrepreneur you should be aware of the market where you are operating.
42 • Where are your services in that market?
43 • How is your company reputation?
44 • Who are your competitors?
45 • How busy are they?
46 • Do they have enough work that will allow you to increase your prices and get quality projects?
47
48 You will always have competition, and if you want to remain in business, you better get to know them!
49
50 It is essential that you know your market, as without this knowledge you cannot plan your route to market
51 or the means of promotion you will use to inform your customers of your existence.
52
53 It is also essential that you have a comprehensive knowledge of your competitors, as this knowledge will
54 allow you to distinguish what the market will stand plus identify the gaps in the market.
55
56 Market, being the geographical area as well as the type of services you are offering to the public, is an
57 essential part of being a successful contractor. By having a good knowledge of both market and
58 competitors you can develop a more effective marketing effort and successful costing and pricing
59 strategies.Chapter 3 - Successful Business Practices Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
36 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1
2 One way in which to obtain knowledge is to join trade associations where you will be in touch not only
3 with competitors, but also with material suppliers, engineers, etc. who are familiar with the construction
4 environment and their input may be of great value.
5
6 Think about competition in three ways:
7
8 Barriers to entry
9 • Competition often means that there is a barrier to entry: someone or something that stands
10 between you and your customers. Facing a barrier to entry does not necessarily mean that
11 another person or company is doing exactly what you are or that it has a specific barrier such as
12 a patent that impedes your entry.
13 • If a customer’s needs are being met, there is a barrier.
14 • Always ask, “What barriers to entry will I have to surmount?”
15 • How is the customer’s need being met right now?
16
17 Differentiation
18 • Failing to differentiate and set up barriers to competitors and imitators inevitably leads to profit
19 erosion. In this race to the bottom, the most efficient producers and the least profitable
20 competitors drive down margins to push out their competition.
21
22 Resources
23 • Competitors are not just a problem; they are a great source of information and ideas.
24 • The larger theme is the ordeal of what could be called commodity hell. The place where
25 executives find themselves when they cannot convince customers that their widgets or services
26 are better than those of their ever-burgeoning competitors. All they can say is, “Yep, we have
27 them too.”
28
29 Failing to differentiate will eventually land you in commodity hell.
30
31 COSTING AND PRICING
32
33 Costing and pricing are the most difficult tasks you need to address.
34
35 It is imperative that you know your break-even point: the number of units sold that will cover the costs of
36 your raw materials, overhead, and production time. Only when you know this figure (plus that of your
37 competitors), will you be comfortable in the knowledge of how high or low your price may go.
38
39 Calculating your break-even point is one of the most useful tools in the costing and bidding of your
40 operations. Your bookkeeper should be able to help you on that task. You should also know what your
41 different mark-up percentages for overhead are, profit.
42
43 How to Cost your Products
44
45 Be sure to price your work for the actual costs you will incur at the time you produce it.
46
47 If labor and material costs are expected to go up dramatically before the end of the year, allow for those
48 increases while preparing the cost of your products.
49
50 If you like the idea of an extended backlog of work, find a way to protect your planned profits from
51 escalating costs of material and labor.
52
53 During the good economic times, there is an abundance of work, so many sins go unnoticed and if you
54 are making money you might not bother to correct those sins.
55
56 You should have bidding policies for both types of economies: thriving and depressed.
57
58 If you must reduce your prices, do not reduce your actual costs. That should never be done. Play with
59 your profit markups and non-cash fixed overhead.Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 3 - Successful Business Practices
Reicon Publishing, LLC 37
1
2 Be careful to watch your overhead expenses. Many construction businesses failed during the recession
3 because they could not cover the cost of the overhead they were committed to.
4
5 Know the cost of doing more business before you do more business, so you can use the right markup to
6 price your jobs profitably.
7
8 Before you increase your overhead costs, test the marketplace you plan to work in to make sure you can
9 sell at the increased pricing you will need and can sell enough work at that price.
10
11 Consider if you are in the right market to do business, but also if you have the right marketing and sales
12 skills in place.
13
14 Regardless of the type of economy in the industry, you should keep your overhead expenses low,
15 specially your fixed expenses.
16
17 Remember, those fixed expenses will be with you even in times when you have no backlog.
18
19 If you are planning on expansion or trying new services, before you increase your capital expenditures,
20 test the market to see if it warrants the additional expenditures.
21
22 Price your new products or services and test them in the marketplace to see the effect of the new
23 operation in your company wellbeing.

25 RISK MANAGEMENT
26
27 Risks are events that can adversely affect the successful outcome of a project or the company. Some of
28 those risks include:
29 • Staff lacking the technical skills to perform the work
30 • Hardware not delivered on time
31 • Infractions of some of the statutes causing down time
32
33 Risks will vary for each company, but the main risks to an organization or project must be identified as
34 soon as possible. Plans must be made to avoid the risk, or, if the risk cannot be avoided, to mitigate the
35 risk to lessen its impact if it occurs. This is known as risk management.
36
37 People associate risk management with insurance. To some extent, that is correct, but there are some
38 risks that cannot be insured by obtaining an insurance policy. Some of the risks facing a construction
39 company are mentioned below. We should identify them and try to correct them before they happen.
40
41 Assign risk factors to those unforeseen events and assign priorities based on those factors, with high risk
42 factors being the most severe ones. Remember risks that are allowed to remain unchecked could spell
43 disaster for any company.
44
45 You do not manage all risks because there could be too many and not all risks have the same impact.
46 • Identify all risks
47 • Estimate the likelihood of each risk occurring (1 = not likely, 2 = maybe likely, 3 = very likely)
48 • Estimate its impact on the project (1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high)
49 • Multiply the two numbers together to obtain the risk factor
50
51 High risk factors indicate the most severe risks. Manage the ten risks with the highest risk factors.
52 Constantly review risks and lookout for new ones since they have a habit of occurring at any moment. Not
53 managing risks effectively is a common reason why projects and companies fail.
54 KEEP GOOD RECORDS
55
56 There is no mystery to bookkeeping. It is nothing more than a filing system of the day-to-day transactions
57 of your business. If you do not record and understand the transactions, your business will control you
58 rather than you are controlling it.
59Chapter 3 - Successful Business Practices Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
38 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 In addition to bookkeeping, we are compelled by the different statutes governing our industry to maintain
2 records of certain activities for a determined period of time.
3
4 As mentioned previously, “you cannot do everything needed in your company.” If it is a task that you are
5 not comfortable with, get help, there is plenty of it out there, just look for it.
6
7 A good outside bookkeeping service will take care of keeping the books to follow the regulations dictated
8 by the governmental agencies and keep you informed of the financial status of your company.
9
10 Business Records Requirements; Address of Record; Service [F.S.
11 489.124]
12
13 This statute reads in part as follows:
14 • (1) All contractors who are registered or certified shall maintain complete financial and business records
15 for the immediately preceding 3 years. The business and financial records to be maintained shall include
16 minutes of corporate meetings, business contacts, telephone records, insurance policies, letters of
17 complaint, notices received from government entities, bank statements, cancelled checks, records of loan
18 documents, tax returns and all other business and financial records…
19
20 Revenue Recognition
21
22 In the construction industry, there are two accepted methods to record income:
23 The percentage of completion method
24 The completed contract method
25
26 The Percentage of Completion Method
27
28 In the percentage of completion method, income is generally recognized when work is performed and
29 recorded when statements are mailed.
30
31 Contractors sometimes receive payments for work not yet performed or only partially completed. The
32 portion of income above the degree of completion is said to be unearned in the accounting sense. It is not
33 earned and should not be recorded as income until the work is done.
34
35 When you receive cash for work that is only partially complete, you have to separate out the unearned
36 portion of income and assign it to a special account. That sum will be recognized as income later, after it
37 is earned. Then you remove it from the special account.
38 That special account, since it will reflect money received from the client that has not been earned, shall
39 be treated as a liability.
40 This is known as percentage of completion accounting because you recognize as income only that
41 portion of money received, or charges billed for work that is completed.
42
43 With this method, your financial statements give a fairly accurate picture of your financial position,
44 including expected profits or losses.
45
46 The advantage of the percentage of completion method is that income and the related costs, expenses,
47 and profits are recognized and reported as the job progresses.
48
49 The disadvantage of the percentage of completion method is that all income, costs, expenses, and profits
50 are only estimates until the job is completed.
51
52 Completed Contract Method
53
54 Recognizing income by the completed contract method has the advantage of exactness.
55
56 There is no need to estimate the degree of completion because all income is recognized only when the
57 job is 100% finished.
58
59 This method is always used for small jobs, such as one-time work, material sales, isolated minorFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 3 - Successful Business Practices
Reicon Publishing, LLC 39
1 contracts, and any other job with a short duration.
2
3 Payment for such work is usually in one installment.
4
5 You can use the completed contract method when you will complete the project within two years from the
6 contract date, and only if your annual gross receipts are under ten million dollars.
7
8 Discuss these methods with your accountant to determine which method is best suited for your company.
9
10 Preparing a Cash Budget
11
12 A cash budget must reflect business realities, since you use it to chart the future course of your operation.
13 There are two principal ways to prepare a cash budget or forecast:
14 • The cash movement method
15 • The source and application of funds method
16
17 The Cash Movement Method
18
19 The cash movement method involves budgeting only the flow of actual cash in and out of your business.
20 This method is especially valuable for builders who have wide variations in their business volume from
21 month-to-month. Such variation usually follows a predictable pattern.
22
23 Budgeting by the cash movement method lets you handle directly the cash flow changes that occur
24 because of monthly volume variations.
25
26 The Source and Application of Funds Method
27
28 The source and application of funds method is more precise than the cash movement method. It assumes
29 that you will attain a certain level of net income. Then it adjusts for non-cash changes to arrive at the net
30 increase or decrease in working capital.
31
32 Our recommendation is to discuss these methods with your accountant to determine which one is the
33 most beneficial for your company to utilize.
34
35 Cash Handling Problems and Solutions
36
37 In this section, we describe some of the problems that employers face with some employees whose
38 responsibility is to handle cash and collections. At the same time, we discuss some of the procedures
39 (solutions) that could be implemented to avoid them.
40
41 Lapping
42
43 Problem: Lapping is when cash is taken from the business by moving outstanding balances from one
44 customer account to another. The thief can write off the amount of cash taken as a bad debt, or they can
45 adjust the amount as a reconciling item to an out-of-balance system.
46 Solution: The way to prevent lapping is to insist on monthly accounts receivable aging lists of all
47 outstanding accounts. Compare this total to a reconciled accounts receivable total.Chapter 3 - Successful Business Practices Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
40 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 Unofficial Borrowing
2
3 Problem: An employee can take cash for periodic “emergencies” and intend to pay back what they
4 borrow someday. However, the employee is often tempted to take more and more until it becomes
5 impossible to repay. This becomes unofficial borrowing.
6 Solution: Establish office rules on petty cash and stringent control on all funds. Carefully monitor your
7 employees who have access to checking and savings accounts, and cash awaiting deposit.
8
9 Failing to Record Cash Sales
10
11 Problem: Sales made for cash are only reported if the sale is recorded. An employee who receives the
12 cash and records the sale has the opportunity to pocket the whole amount by failing to record the cash
13 sale.
14 Solution:
15 • Set up an effective method of accepting cash
16 • Use invoices for billings and orders, and fill out sales receipts for cash sales
17 • File a copy of the invoice or receipt with the cash when it is received
18 • Keep and be able to justify all voided receipts and invoices
19
20 Falsifying or Taking Discount Amounts
21
22 Problem: Falsifying or taking discount amounts is when an employee makes a purchase, gets a receipt
23 for the net amount, and then pockets the discount amount. Another way is when a bill has been paid in
24 full, but the vendor sends a refund for the discount and the employee pockets that amount.
25 Solution:
26 • Know the discount terms of your suppliers.
27 • Implement a monthly discount summary so that you can verify the terms used by your employees against
28 those quoted by your suppliers.
29
30 Taking Payments and Writing off Accounts as Bad Debts
31
32 Problem: Taking payments and writing off accounts as bad debts is when an employee receives a
33 payment for a small invoice, pockets the money, and then writes that amount in accounts receivable as a
34 bad debt.
35 Solution:
36 • Approve all write-offs yourself
37 • Never delegate this job to others
38 • Prepare the bad debt analysis yourself for greater security
39 Financial Statements
40
41 Financial statements summarize your operation’s activity for a certain period, usually a month, quarter, or
42 year, and show its status at the end of that period.
43
44 There are three distinct financial statements:
45 • Balance sheet
46 • Income statement
47 • Statement of cash flow
48
49 Balance Sheet
50
51 The balance sheet is a summary of the existing conditions of the business. It lists the assets (things you
52 own), liabilities (things you owe), and net worth of the business as of a given date.Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 3 - Successful Business Practices
Reicon Publishing, LLC 41
1 Income Statement
2
3 The income statement summarizes business operations within a time period. The ending date of that
4 period is always the same as the closing date on the balance sheet.
5
6 The income statement is broken down into these standard divisions:
7 • Sales - Revenues
8 • Expenses - Costs
9 • Net income from operations
10
11 Statement of Cash Flows
12
13 The statement of cash flows is a summary of the sources and uses of cash – where it came from and
14 where it went - for the same period covered by the income statement.
15
16 Funds are generally from the following sources:
17 • Cash basis net income
18 • Sale of assets
19 • Increase in liabilities
20 • Decrease of other assets
21
22 The application or uses of funds include the purchase of long-term assets (equipment), the decrease of
23 liabilities, and the payment of taxes.
24
25 Any time you change the sources or applications of your funds, you affect your current assets and
26 liabilities.
27
28 Tips
29
30 You are a link in the chain of the business; form good relationships with other links.
31
32 Be professional. You are the main asset of your business.
33
34 Indecisiveness wastes time. Gain knowledge and make informed decisions.
35
36 Getting finance is not easy. Acquire it wisely. Spend it wisely.
37
38 You may have an excellent product but, if you are not getting adequately paid for it, you are not in
39 business.

19 rule of the applicable board or, if no such board exists, by rule of the department. Upon receipt of the
20 appropriate license fee, except as provided in subsection (4) (3), the department shall issue a license to
21 any person certified by the appropriate board, or its designee, or the department when there is no board,
22 as having met the applicable requirements imposed by law or rule. However, an applicant who is not
23 otherwise qualified for licensure is not entitled to licensure solely based on a passing score on a required
24 examination. Upon a determination by the department that it erroneously issued a license, or upon the
25 revocation of a license by the applicable board, or by the department when there is no board, the licensee
26 must surrender his or her license to the department.
27 (3)(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the applicable board shall use the process in this subsection for

41 certification program.
42 (b)1. A conviction, or any other adjudication, for a crime more than 5 years before the date the application
43 is received by the applicable board may not be grounds for denial of a license specified in paragraph (a).
44 For purposes of this paragraph, the term “conviction” means a determination of guilt that is the result of a
45 plea or trial, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld. This paragraph does not limit the applicable
46 board from considering an applicant’s criminal history that includes a crime listed in s. 775.21(4)(a)1. or s.
47 776.08 at any time, but only if such criminal history has been found to relate to the practice of the
48 applicable profession.

2 Corrections before it issues a license.
3 3. If an applicant is unable to appear in person due to his or her confinement or supervision, the
4 applicable board must permit the applicant to appear by teleconference or video conference, as
5 appropriate, at any meeting of the applicable board or other hearing by the agency concerning his or her
6 application.
7 4. If an applicant is confined or under supervision, the Department of Corrections and the applicable
8 board shall cooperate and coordinate to facilitate the appearance of the applicant at a board meeting or
9 agency hearing in person, by teleconference, or by video conference, as appropriate.
10
11 (d) Each applicable board shall compile a list of crimes that, if committed and regardless of adjudication,
12 do not relate to the practice of the profession or the ability to practice the profession and do not constitute
13 grounds for denial of a license. This list must be made available on the department’s website and updated
14 annually. Beginning October 1, 2019, each applicable board shall compile a list of crimes that although
15 reported by an applicant for licensure, were not used as a basis for denial. The list must identify for each
16 such license application the crime reported and the date of conviction and whether there was a finding of
17 guilt, a plea, or an adjudication entered or the date of sentencing.
18
19 (e) Each applicable board shall compile a list of crimes that have been used as a basis for denial of a
20 license in the past 2 years and shall make the list available on the department’s website. Starting October
21 1, 2019, and updated quarterly thereafter, the applicable board shall compile a list indicating each crime
22 used as a basis for denial. For each crime listed, the applicable board must identify the date of conviction,
23 finding of guilt, plea, or adjudication entered, or date of sentencing. Such denials must be made available
24 to the public upon request.

35 in which a licensee becomes delinquent. Failure by a delinquent status licensee to become active or
36 inactive before the expiration of the current licensure cycle shall render the license void without any
37 further action by the board or the department. The board, or the department if there is no board, shall, by
38 rule, establish a reinstatement process for void licenses.

12 subsections (5) and (6) are added to that section, to read:
13
14 489.126 Moneys received by contractors.
15
16 (2)(a) A contractor who receives, as initial payment, money totaling more than 10 percent of the contract
17 price for repair, restoration, improvement, or construction to residential real property must:
18 1.(a) Apply for permits necessary to do work within 30 days after the date payment is made, except
19 where the work does not require a permit under the applicable codes and ordinances, and
20 2.(b) Start the work within 90 days after the date all necessary permits for work, if any, are issued, unless
21 the contractor has just cause for failing to apply for the necessary permits, starting the work, or refunding
22 the payment, or unless the person who made the payment agreed, in writing, to a longer period to apply
23 for the necessary permits or start the work or to longer periods for both.
24 (b)1. If a contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a), the contractee must make
25 written demand to the contractor in the form of a letter that includes a demand to apply for the necessary
26 permits, to start the work, or to refund the payment sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, mailed
27 to the address listed in the contracting agreement. If there is no address for the contractor listed in the
28 contracting agreement, or no written agreement exists, the contractee must mail the written demand letter
29 to the address listed for licensing purposes with the department or the local construction industry
30 licensing board, if applicable.
31 2. It may be inferred that a contractor does not have just cause if the contractor fails to apply for the
32 necessary permits, start the work, or refund payments within 30 days of receiving written demand to apply
33 for the necessary permits, start the work, or refund the payment from the person who made the payment.
34 (3)(a) A contractor who receives money for repair, restoration, addition, improvement, or construction of
35 residential real property in excess of the value of the work performed may shall not, with intent to defraud
36 the owner, fail or refuse to perform any work for any 90-day period or for any period that is mutually
37 agreed upon and specified in the contract.
38 (b) It is prima facie evidence Proof that a contractor received money for the repair, restoration, addition,
39 improvement, or construction of residential real property and that the amount received exceeds the value
40 of the work performed by the contractor when and that:
41 1. The contractor failed to perform any of the work for which he or she contracted during any 90-day 60-
42 day period or any period that is mutually agreed upon and specified in the contract;
43 2. The failure to perform any such work during the 90-day 60-day period or such period that is mutually
44 agreed upon and specified in the contract was not related to the owner’s termination of the contract or a
45 material breach of the contract by the owner; and
46 3. The contractor failed to perform for the 90-day period or such period that is mutually agreed upon and
47 specified in the contract without just cause or terminated the contract without proper notification to the
48 owner.
49 a. Proper notification of termination for purposes of this subparagraph must be made by the contractor in
50 the form of a letter that includes the reason for termination of the contract or the reason for failure to
51 perform sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, mailed to the address of the owner listed in theChapter - 4 - The Principles of Florida Statutes & Rules Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
48 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 contracting agreement. If no written agreement exists, the letter must be mailed to the address where the
2 work was to be performed or the address listed on the permit, if applicable.
3 b. If a contractor fails to comply with paragraph (a), written demand must be made to the contractor in the
4 form of a letter that includes a demand to perform work, or refund the money received in excess of the
5 value of the work performed, sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, mailed to the address listed
6 in the contracting agreement. If there is no address for the contractor listed in the contracting agreement,
7 or no agreement exists, the letter must be mailed to the address listed with the department for licensing
8 purposes or the local construction industry licensing board, if applicable.
9 c. It may be inferred that a contractor does not have just cause if the contractor fails to perform work, or
10 refund the money received in excess of the value of the work performed, within 30 days after receiving a
11 written demand to perform the work, or refund the money received in excess of the value of the work
12 performed, from the person who made the payment, for an additional 30-day period after the date of
13 mailing of notification as specified in paragraph (c), to perform any work for which he or she contracted,
14 gives rise to an inference that the money in excess of the value of the work performed was taken with the
15 intent to defraud.
16 (d)(c) Notification as contemplated in paragraph (b) consists of a certified letter, return receipt requested,
17 mailed to the address of the contractor as listed in the written contracting agreement. The letter must
18 indicate that the contractor has failed to perform any work for a 60-day period, that the failure to perform
19 the work was not the result of the owner’s termination of the contract or a material breach of the contract
20 by the owner, and that the contractor must recommence construction within 30 days after the date of
21 mailing of the letter. If there is no address for the contractor listed in the written contracting agreement, or
22 no written agreement exists, the letter must be mailed to the address of the contractor listed in the
23 building permit application.
24 (4) Any violation of subsection (2) or subsection (3) must be prosecuted in accordance with the thresholds
25 established in this section and the following: person who violates any provision of this section is guilty of
26 theft and shall be prosecuted and punished under s. 812.014.
27 (a) The required intent to prove a criminal violation may be shown to exist at the time that the contractor
28 appropriated the money to his or her own use and is not required to be proven to exist at the time of the
29 taking of the money from the owner or at the time the owner makes a payment to the contractor.
30 (b) It may be inferred that a contractor intended to deprive the owner of the right to the money owed, or
31 deprive the owner of the benefit from it, and inferred that the contractor appropriated the money for his or
32 her own use, or to a person not entitled to the use of the money, if the contractor fails to refund any
33 portion of the money owed within 30 days after receiving a written demand for such money from the
34 owner.
35 (c) In a prosecution for a violation of this section, the fact that the person so charged intended to return
36 the money owed is not a defense.
37 (5) A person who violates subsection (2) commits:
38 (a) A misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, if the total
39 money received is less than $1,000.
40 (b) A felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the
41 total money received is $1,000 or more, but less than $20,000.
42 (c) A felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the
43 total money received is $20,000 or more, but less than $200,000.
44 (d) A felony of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the
45 total money received is $200,000 or more.
46 (6) A person who violates subsection (3) commits:
47 (a) A misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, if the total
48 money received exceeding the value of the work performed is less than $1,000.
49 (b) A felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the
50 total money received exceeding the value of the work performed is $1,000 or more, but less than

12
13 (6)(b) - An owner of property completing the requirements of a building permit, where the contractor listed
14 on the permit substantially completed the project as determined by the local permitting agency, for a one-
15 family or two-family residence, townhome, accessory structure of a one-family or two-family residence or
16 townhome or individual residential condominium unit or cooperative unit. Prior to the owner qualifying for
17 the exemption, the owner must receive approval from the local permitting agency, and the local permitting
18 agency must determine that the contractor substantially completed the project. An owner who qualifies for
19 the exemption under this paragraph is not required to occupy the dwelling or unit for at least 1 year after
20 the completion of the project.

35
36 489.553 Administration of part; registration qualifications; examination.
37
38 (7) Notwithstanding any other law, a conviction, or any other adjudication, for a crime more than 5 years
39 before the date the application is received by the department or other applicable authority may not be
40 grounds for denial of registration. For purposes of this subsection, the term “conviction” means a
41 determination of guilt that is the result of a plea or trial, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld.
42 This subsection does not limit a board from considering an applicant’s criminal history that includes any
43 crime listed in s. 775.21(4)(a)1. or s. 776.08 at any time, but only if such criminal history has been found
44 to relate to the practice of the applicable profession, or any crime if it has been found to relate to good
45 moral character.
46 (8)(a) A person may apply to be registered before his or her lawful release from confinement or
47 supervision. The department or other applicable authority may not charge an applicant an additional fee
48 for being confined or under supervision. The department or other applicable authority may not deny an
49 application for registration solely on the basis of the applicant’s current confinement or supervision.
50 (b) After a registration application is approved, the department or other applicable authority may stay the
51 issuance of registration until the applicant is lawfully released from confinement or supervision and the
52 applicant notifies the board of such release. The department or other applicable authority must verify the
53 applicant’s release with the Department of Corrections before it registers such applicant.
54 (c) If an applicant is unable to appear in person due to his or her confinement or supervision, the
55 department or other applicable authority must permit the applicant to appear by teleconference or video
56 conference, as appropriate, at any meeting or hearing by the department or other applicable authority
57 concerning his or her application.Chapter - 4 - The Principles of Florida Statutes & Rules Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
50 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 (d) If an applicant is confined or under supervision, the Department of Corrections and the department or
2 other applicable authority shall cooperate and coordinate to facilitate the appearance of the applicant at a
3 meeting or hearing in person, by teleconference, or by video conference, as appropriate.
4 (9) The department or other applicable authority shall compile a list of crimes that, if committed and
5 regardless of adjudication, do not relate to the practice of the profession or the ability to practice the
6 profession and do not constitute grounds for denial of registration. This list must be made available on the
7 department’s website and updated annually. Beginning October 1, 2019, and updated quarterly
8 thereafter, the department or other applicable authority shall add to this list such crimes that although
9 reported by an applicant for registration, were not used as a basis for denial in the past 2 years. The list
10 must identify for each such registration application the crime reported and the date of conviction, plea,
11 adjudication, or sentencing.
12 (10) The department or other applicable authority shall compile a list of crimes that have been used as a
13 basis for denial of registration in the past 2 years and make the list available on the department’s website.
14 Beginning October 1, 2019, and updated quarterly thereafter, the department shall add to this list each
15 crime used as a basis for denial. For each crime listed, the department must identify the date of
16 conviction, plea, adjudication, or sentencing. Such denials must be made available to the public upon
17 request.

22 Section 4. Paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 713.23, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
23
24 713.23 Payment bond.
25
26 (1)(d) In addition, a lienor who has not received payment for furnishing his or her labor, services, or
27 materials must be required, as a condition precedent to recovery under the bond, to serve a written notice
28 of nonpayment to the contractor and the surety. The notice must be under oath and served during the
29 progress of the work or thereafter, but may not be served not later than 90 days after the final furnishing
30 of labor, services, or materials by the lienor, or, with respect to rental equipment, later than 90 days after
31 the date the rental equipment was on the job site and available for use. A notice of nonpayment that
32 includes sums for retainage must specify the portion of the amount claimed for retainage. The required. A
33 written notice satisfies this condition precedent with respect to the payment described in the notice of
34 nonpayment, including unpaid finance charges due under the lienor’s contract, and with respect to any
35 other payments which become due to the lienor after the date of the notice of nonpayment.
36
37 The time period for serving a written notice of nonpayment shall be measured from the last day of
38 furnishing labor, services, or materials by the lienor and may shall not be measured by other standards,
39 such as the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or the issuance of a certificate of substantial
40 completion. The failure of a lienor to receive retainage sums not in excess of 10 percent of the value of
41 labor, services, or materials furnished by the lienor is not considered a nonpayment requiring the service
42 of the notice provided under this paragraph. If the payment bond is not recorded before commencement
43 of construction, the time period for the lienor to serve a notice of nonpayment may at the option of the
44 lienor be calculated from the date specified in this section or the date the lienor is served a copy of the
45 bond. However, the limitation period for commencement of an action on the payment bond as established
46 in paragraph (e) may not be expanded. The negligent inclusion or omission of any information in the
47 notice of nonpayment that has not prejudiced the contractor or surety does not constitute a default that
48 operates to defeat an otherwise valid bond claim. A lienor who serves a fraudulent notice of nonpayment
49 forfeits his or her rights under the bond. A notice of nonpayment is fraudulent if the lienor has willfully
50 exaggerated the amount unpaid, willfully included a claim for work not performed or materials not
51 furnished for the subject improvement or prepared the notice with such willful and gross negligence as to
52 amount to a willful exaggeration. However, a minor mistake or error in a notice of nonpayment, or a good
53 faith dispute as to the amount unpaid, does not constitute a willful exaggeration that operates to defeat an
54 otherwise valid claim against the bond. The service of a fraudulent notice of nonpayment is a complete
55 defense to the lienor’s claim against the bond. The notice under this paragraph must include the following
56 information, current as of the date of the notice, and must may be in substantially the following form:

33 This bill effects the engineering profession as it amends F.S. 455 and F.S. 471 for reinstatement of void
34 licenses. Additional effects include:
35
36 • It removes the requirement that all delinquent status licensees, licensed by the DBPR or a board
37 in accordance with F.S. 455 must apply for reinstatement with a complete application, and
38 instead, the bill requires boards, or the DBPR if there is no board, to adopt by rule a process for
39 reinstating applicants with void licenses.
40 • It removes the requirement that engineers obtain a separate license (certificate of authorization)
41 for their engineering firm.
42 • It requires a licensed engineer to qualify an engineering firm without paying a separate licensing
43 fee.
44 • For a project that is wholly or partially funded by the department and administered by a local
45 governmental entity, the design services and construction engineering and inspection services
46 may not be performed by the same entity.
47 • It provides an additional pathway for licensure as a professional engineer after receiving an
48 engineering technology degree.
49 • It requires applicants for licensure to submit proof of being 18 years of age or older.
50 • It requires the Board of Professional Engineers to extend certain deadlines for granting or
51 denying a license after an applicant fails to appear before the board.
52 • It provides a temporary “registration” instead of a temporary “certificate” or “license” for out-of-
53 state engineering businesses.
54 • It requires successor engineers to assume full responsibility when relying on the work, findings, or
55 recommendations of an engineer who previously sealed such documents and releases the
56 original engineer from liability for prior work assumed by the successor engineer.
57 • It includes repair and restoration works in which a structural system or structural loading of a
58 building is modified. The enforcing agency shall require a special inspector to perform inspectionsChapter - 4 - The Principles of Florida Statutes & Rules Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle

22 House Bill 827 - Effective October 1, 2019 - Summary
23
24 Engineering technology degrees: Currently, only graduates with engineering sciences degrees from
25 board-approved programs are eligible for licensure in Florida. NOW graduates with bachelor’s degrees in
26 engineering technology from board-approved programs will qualify to apply
27
28 Decoupling experience and exam eligibility: Those who have passed the fundamentals of engineering
29 exam will be able to take the principles and practice of engineering exam before completing the years of
30 experience needed to apply for licensure.
31 a. Applicants with bachelor’s degrees in engineering sciences will still need four years of active
32 engineering experience to apply, but those with bachelor’s in engineering technology will be
33 required to have six years of active engineering experience.
34 b. Additionally, all applicants in Florida will have to be at least 18 Yrs.
35
36 Engineering firms: Engineering firms will not be required to apply for a certificate of authorization (CA)
37 and pay a fee. Firms must register their business with the board and be qualified by a professional
38 engineer licensed in Florida.
39 c. Rather than renewing a CA every two years, the qualifying engineer of a firm must notify the
40 board within 30 days of any changes to information in the firm’s initial registration application.
41 d. A qualifying engineer who leaves an engineering firm must notify the board within 24 hours. If the
42 qualifying engineer was the only qualifying agent for the business, the firm may no longer provide
43 engineering services in Florida and must be qualified by another qualifying engineer within 60
44 days if it wishes to resume offering engineering services.
45
46 Successor engineers: The new law requires successor engineers to assume full professional and legal
47 responsibility of engineering documents when assuming an existing project from another engineer. The
48 revision also releases the original engineer from professional responsibility and civil liability for prior work
49 assumed by a successor engineer.
50Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter - 4 - The Principles of Florida Statutes & Rules
Reicon Publishing, LLC 53
1 Education waiver: A change to 471.013 removes a waiver that allowed someone with ten years of active
2 engineering experience who notified the DBPR before July 1, 1984, of their intent to seek a PE license,
3 and was engaged in engineering work on July 1, 1981, to apply for licensure without meeting the
4 education requirements. That original waiver is not valid after October 1, 2019.
5 Other changes that affect engineering: Design services and construction engineering and inspection
6 services CAN’T be performed by the same entity on projects receiving funding from the Florida
7 Department of Transportation that are administered by a local government entity.
8 e. Holders of a license issued by Florida that has gone null and void will be able to go through a
9 process to have their license and number reinstated.
10 f. The new law expands requirements in F.S. 553.79. In addition to new construction, special
11 inspectors of threshold buildings will be required to inspect repair and restoration projects in
12 which the structural system or structural loading of a building has been modified.

16 This section outlines the 2020 list house and senate bills that made changes to Florida Statutes effecting
17 the construction industry
18
19
20 Senate Bill No. 1606.
21
22 An act relating to insurance administration; amending ss. 440.12 and 440.20, F.S.; authorizing the
23 payment of certain workers’ compensation benefits to be transmitted to the employee’s account with a
24 licensed money transmitter. Signed into law in June 2020 and becoming effective on July 1, 2020.
25
26 F.S 440.12 Time for commencement and limits on weekly rate of compensation.
27
28 (1) Compensation is not allowed for the first 7 days of the disability, except for benefits provided under s.
29 440.13. However, if the injury results in more than 21 days of disability, compensation is allowed from the
30 commencement of the disability.
31
32 All weekly compensation payments, except for the first payment, must be paid by check or, if authorized
33 by the employee, paid on a prepaid card pursuant to paragraph (b), deposited directly into the employee’s
34 account at a financial institution as defined in s. 655.005, or transmitted to the employee’s account with a
35 money transmitter licensed under part II of chapter 560.
36
37
38 F.S 440.20 Time for payment of compensation and medical bills; penalties for late payment.
39
40 (1)(a) Unless the carrier denies compensability or entitlement to benefits, the carrier shall pay
41 compensation directly to the employee as required by ss. 440.14, 440.15, and 440.16, in accordance with
42 those sections. Upon receipt of the employee’s authorization as provided for in s. 440.12(1)(a), the
43 carrier’s obligation to pay compensation directly to the employee is satisfied when the carrier directly
44 deposits, by electronic transfer or other means, compensation into the employee’s account at a financial
45 institution as defined in s. 655.005 or onto a prepaid card in accordance with s. 440.12(1) or transmits the
46 employee’s compensation to the employee’s account with a money transmitter licensed under part II of
47 chapter 560. Compensation by direct deposit, the use of a prepaid card, or through transmission is
48 considered paid on the date the funds become available for withdrawal by the employee.
49
50 (6)(a) If any installment of compensation for death or dependency benefits, or compensation for disability
51 benefits payable without an award is not paid within 7 days after it becomes due, as provided in
52 subsection (2), subsection (3), or subsection (4), there shall be added to such unpaid installment a
53 penalty of an amount equal to 20 percent of the unpaid installment, which shall be paid at the same time
54 as, but in addition to, such installment of compensation. This penalty shall not apply for late payments
55 resulting from conditions over which the employer or carrier had no control. When any installment of

11 HB 401 – Florida Building Code
12
13 As it pertains to the administration of the Building Code, the bill:
14 • Allows a substantially affected person to petition the Commission for a non-binding advisory opinion
15 on whether a local government regulation is an improper amendment to the Building Code, and
16 establishes a process for such petitions;
17 • Allows the Commission to issue an “errata to the code” to list demonstrated errors in provisions
18 • contained within the Building Code;
19 • Requires the Commission to adopt rules for approving product evaluation entities in addition to the
20 ones already listed and approved in current law;
21 • Clarifies that the Commission may suspend product evaluation entities;
22 • Clarifies that local government entities may use private providers for their own construction projects;
23 • Provides that a local government may use excess funds generated by Building Code enforcement for
24 the construction of a building or structure that houses the local government’s building department or
25 provides training programs for building officials, inspectors, or plans examiners;
26 • Provides that excess funds used to construct such a building or structure must be designated for such
27 purpose by the local government and may not be carried forward for more than four years; and
28 • Prohibits a local government from requiring a contract between a builder and an owner as a condition
29 to apply for or obtain a building permit.
30 • Specifies that a local government may not use preliminary maps issued by the Federal Emergency
31 Management Agency for any law, ordinance, rule, or other measure that has the effect of imposing
32 land use changes or permits.
33 • The bill makes several changes to current law pertaining to licensed individuals providing private
34 building inspection services, known as “private providers.” Current law allows contractors and
35 property owners to hire licensed building code administrators, engineers, and architects to review
36 building plans, perform building inspections, and prepare certificates of completion. The bill makes
37 the following changes to the private provider statute:
38 • Expressly authorizes private providers to conduct virtual building inspections.
39 • Allows private providers to submit various inspection forms, records, and reports electronically to local
40 building departments and utilize electronic signatures.
41 • Allows private providers to conduct “single-trade inspections,” as defined in the bill.
42 • Authorizes private providers to conduct emergency inspection services.
43 • Additionally, the bill expressly authorizes local governments and school districts to use private
44 providers for public works projects and improvements to any building or structure.
45 • Finally, the bill amends the Community Planning Act to prohibit local governments from adopting land
46 development regulations that regulate specific building design elements (such as exterior color and
47 cladding, ornamentation, styling of windows and doors, etc.) for single- and two-family dwellings.
48 However, certain exceptions are provided that allow local governments to regulate such building
49 design elements when: The dwelling is a historic property or located in a historic district, a community
50 redevelopment area, or a planned unit development or master planned community.

33 statewide building code for all construction in the state and must be applied, administered, and enforced
34 uniformly and consistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
35
36 Local governments enforce the Building Code within their jurisdictions, primarily by conducting
37 inspections and issuing building permits to authorize construction. It is unlawful to construct, alter, repair,
38 or demolish a building without obtaining a building permit.
39
40 The bill makes various changes to the ways in which local enforcement agencies receive and process
41 building permit applications. Specifically, the bill requires local enforcement agencies to:
42 Allow building permit applications, including payments, attachments, drawings, and other documents, to
43 be submitted electronically.
44 Post the current status of every building permit application received on its website.
45 Post the agency’s procedures for reviewing, processing, and approving building permit applications on its
46 website.
47 Review additional information for an application for a development permit or development order within a
48 certain time-period.
49 Allow building permit applicants 10 business days to correct an application for a single-family residential
50 dwelling that was initially denied by the local enforcement agency.
51 Reduce permit fees by specified amounts after failing to meet statutory deadlines for reviewing certain
52 building permit applications.
53
54 Finally, the bill prohibits government entities, which enforce the Building Code, from requiring a copy of a
55 contractor’s contract with owners, subcontractors, or suppliers in order to obtain a building permit for
56 projects on commercial property.Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter - 4 - The Principles of Florida Statutes & Rules

15
16 The Overall Product Approval System
17
18 Product approval in Florida is a 3 three path process
19 Each path is defined by Florida Statute and/or contained in the Building Code Chapter 1
20 We will look at each step to view the options.
21
22 The Guiding Statute
23
24 Florida Statute 553 establishes the Florida Building Commission, guides the Florida Building Code, and
25 provides the overall guidance.
26
27 The areas that guide this process are:
28 553.841.
29 553.842.
30 Florida Building Code Chapter 1 – Administration.
31
32 The First Step
33
34 The Building Official has the authority to approve products that he/she feels meet the intent and
35 requirements of the Code .
36
37 [A]104.9 Approved materials and equipment.
38
39 Materials, equipment, and devices approved by the building official shall be constructed and installed in
40 accordance with such approval.
41
42 [A]104.9.1 Used materials and equipment.
43
44 The use of used materials that meet the requirements of this code for new materials is permitted. Used
45 equipment and devices shall not be reused unless approved by the building official.
46
47 The Building Official Approval
48
49 If the Building Official is comfortable with the information provided, the BO may approve the use.
50
51 If the Building Official is not familiar with the product, is not comfortable with the design or calculations,
52 then
53
54 The Building Official can go to Step 2 and/ or 3.
55
56
57 The Second Step
58Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 5 - Understanding Product Approval
Reicon Publishing, LLC 83
1 The Building Official can request information documenting the product, the design, test information or
2 other information related to the product.
3
4 This information may be a test report from a recognized test lab.
5
6 These reports are items such as a Miami Dade Notice of Acceptance (NOA), an ICC Evaluation Services
7 (ICC ES) report, a Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) report, or
8
9 A rational Analysis of a previous or similar report about the product and the specific installation from an
10 expert, such as a Professional Engineer.
11
12 Most Building Officials are not experts in every field.
13
14 Most Building Officials are not practicing engineers.
15
16 Documentation and verification of products and their performance is generally required.
17
18 This information is readily available from the various testing entities and manufacturers.
19
20 Let us look at the statutory wording.
21
22 553.8425 - Local Product Approval.
23
24 1) For local product approval, products or systems of construction shall demonstrate compliance with
25 the structural windload requirements of the Florida Building Code through one of the following
26 methods:
27
28 a) A certification mark, listing, or label from a commission-approved certification agency indicating
29 that the product complies with the code;
30
31 b) A test report from a commission-approved testing laboratory indicating that the product tested
32 complies with the code;
33
34 c) A product-evaluation report based upon testing, comparative or rational analysis, or a
35 combination thereof, from a commission-approved product evaluation entity which indicates that
36 the product evaluated complies with the code;
37
38 d) A product-evaluation report or certification based upon testing or comparative or rational analysis,
39 or a combination thereof, developed and signed and sealed by a Florida professional engineer or
40 Florida registered architect, which indicates that the product complies with the code;
41
42 e) A statewide product approval issued by the Florida Building Commission; or
43
44 f) Designation of compliance with a prescriptive, material standard adopted by the commission by
45 rule under s. 553.842(15).
46
47 The Third Step
48
49 If Other Options Are Not Available - The third step is the Florida Product Approval System.
50
51 This was established to have a central clearing house of products that meet the Florida Building Code for
52 specific installations.
53
54 An Important Note!
55
56 No matter which system is used, just because a product has a test sheet or product approval number, the
57 use of that product must still meet the specific criteria of the installation.
58 This relates to design pressures, impact rating, fire resistance and attachment methods applicable to the
59 installation.
60
61 553.842 - Product evaluation and approvalChapter 5 - Understanding Product Approval Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
84 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1
2 1) The commission shall adopt rules under ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to develop and implement a
3 product evaluation and approval system that applies statewide to operate in coordination with the
4 Florida Building Code. The commission may enter into contracts to provide for administration of the
5 product evaluation and approval system. The commission’s rules and any applicable contract may
6 provide that the payment of fees related to approvals be made directly to the administrator. Any fee
7 paid by a product manufacturer shall be used only for funding the product evaluation and approval
8 system. The product evaluation and approval system shall provide:
9
10 a) Appropriate promotion of innovation and new technologies.
11
12 b) Processing submittals of products from manufacturers in a timely manner.
13
14 c) Independent, third-party qualified and accredited testing and laboratory facilities, product
15 evaluation entities, quality assurance agencies, certification agencies, and validation entities.
16
17 d) An easily accessible product acceptance list to entities subject to the Florida Building Code.
18
19 e) Development of stringent but reasonable testing criteria based upon existing consensus
20 standards, when available, for products.
21
22 f) Long-term approvals, where feasible. State and local approvals will be valid until the
23 requirements of the code on which the approval is based change, the product changes in a
24 manner affecting its performance as required by the code, or the approval is revoked. However,
25 the commission may authorize by rule editorial revisions to approvals and charge a fee as
26 provided in this section.
27
28 g) Criteria for revocation of a product approval.
29
30 h) Cost-effectiveness.
31
32 Parenthesis 2 tells us that this system is designed to rely on national and international consensus
33 standards. This leads us back to the existing approval systems and to the published reports.
34
35 2) The product evaluation and approval system shall rely on national and international consensus
36 standards, whenever adopted by the Florida Building Code, for demonstrating compliance with
37 code standards. Other standards which meet or exceed established state requirements shall also
38 be considered.
39
40 The Commission Operation

25 Energy Through the Years
26
27 Florida Energy Code goes back to the 1970’s.
28 Many different methods have been employed over the years in attempts to gain efficiency.
29 Major changes have taken place over the last code change cycles.
30 The Florida Energy Conservation Volume is patterned after and based on the International Energy
31 Conservation Code (IECC).
32 There is a Commercial section and a Residential section.
33 The Florida Codes are updated every three years.
34 • The next edition is scheduled to take effect December 31, 2026.
35
36 What it is trying to achieve
37
38 The goal of the Energy Conservation volume is to reduce overall energy and water usage.
39 Much talk has taken place about the building envelope, this was the original focus for energy.
40 Other systems are now included as we continue to strive for energy reductions.
41 Energy involves all trades and systemsChapter 6 - Energy Conservation Volume Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle

1 The Need for Inspections and Documentation
2
3 As systems progress, some get simpler, and others become more complex. Training and education are
4 paramount to achieving the goals of energy reduction. Knowledge of the codes and understanding the
5 how and why is important to achieve efficiency.
6
7 When the designers, contractors, plan reviewers, inspectors, and owners work together, we can achieve
8 this lofty goal. Inspections help to ensure the requirements are being followed. Inspections are required
9 by Sections C104 and R104.

8 One set of construction documents so reviewed shall be retained by the code official. The other set shall
9 be returned to the applicant, kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the code official or
10 a duly authorized representative.
11
12 This is a Code requirement!
13
14 WHERE ARE THESE OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT ARE THEY
15 FOR?
16
17 Finding Code Requirements
18
19 Finding the specific code requirements should not be difficult once you understand the layout:
20
21 • Start by determining if the project is Commercial or Residential
22 • Next, determine if the design is prescriptive or performance
23 • Remember, the mandatory sections apply either way!
24
25 For terms you are not familiar with, use the definitions found in Chapter 2.
26
27 It is good to review the terms contained here so you know if some of the common terminology may have
28 special meaning in this volume of the Code.
29
30 Attic is an example of this.
31 We ordinarily think of the attic as the space above the highest floor ceiling.
32 When applying the Energy Conservation volume, it is:
33 • An enclosed unconditioned space located immediately below an uninsulated roof and
34 immediately above the ceiling of a building.
35
36 C101.2 Scope.
37
38 This code applies to commercial buildings and the buildings’ sites and associated systems and
39 equipment.
40
41 C101.4.1 Mixed occupancy
42
43 Where a building includes both residential and commercial occupancies, each occupancy shall be
44 separately considered and meet the applicable provisions of Florida Building Code, Energy
45 Conservation—Commercial Provisions or Florida Building Code, Energy Conservation—Residential

2 Each portion applies to the Occupancy as defined in the Building Code volume that is applicable.
3
4 This means:
5
6 A condominium has commercial and residential portions.
7 The portions representing the group R, Residential units must comply with the Residential sections.
8 Hallways, common areas and all commercial areas must comply with the commercial portions of the
9 volume.
10 Put simply, if it is not Residential, the commercial sections apply.
11 Each section has a General Requirements part.
12 Each part has definitions specific to that part
13 Chapter 3 of each part covers General Requirements.
14 Chapter 4 of each part addresses Energy Efficiency.
15 Chapter 5 covers Existing Buildings.
16 Each section then contains the Referenced Standards, forms, and applicable appendixes.
17
18 As you utilize the Florida Energy Conservation volume, you will see it provides much information, both
19 required and optional paths for compliance.
20
21 The Prescriptive Path is similar to a recipe, where you follow the directions and install the items
22 required.
23
24 The Performance Path provides for versatility in design and application, usually modeled using computer
25 software.
26
27 Some items are still mandatory!
28
29 Commercial/Residential Chapter 3
30
31 Florida has 2 climate zones:
32
33 • Zone 1A is the southernmost portion of the state.
34 • Zone 2A is the remainder of the state.
35
36 All of Florida is designated as warm-humid locations. Chapter 3 also provides us with:
37
38 • Insulation requirements.
39 • Fenestration product ratings.
40 • Maintenance requirement information.
41 • Assembly calculation (Commercial).
42
43 Commercial Chapter 4
44
45 Chapter 4 starts with providing the design paths that may be used:
46
47 C401.2 Application.
48
49 Commercial buildings shall comply with one of the following:
50
51 • 1. The requirements of ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1, excluding section 9.4.1.1(g) of the standard.
52 • 2. The requirements of Sections C402 through C405. In addition, commercial buildings shall
53 comply with Section C406 and tenant spaces shall comply with Section C406.1.1.

55 C407. The building energy cost shall be equal to or less than 85 percent of the standard
56 reference design building.
57
58 Option 1 refers to ASHRAE 90.1:
59Chapter 6 - Energy Conservation Volume Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
106 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 This is a standard in the industry.
2 Many of the requirements that are found in the text of the prescriptive requirements originate in this
3 document.
4 The book is published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air conditioning Engineers.
5 It is intended for all buildings except for low-rise residential.
6 It is considered the benchmark for energy efficiency.
7
8 Option 2 is the prescriptive path.
9
10 This path provides “directions” in the form of code requirements and options to meet them.
11 The envelope is addressed in much detail as this was the focus of energy savings from the start.
12 This is followed by fenestrations (windows and doors).
13 Then comes the air barrier to round out the thermal envelope.
14 It has been said we have gone as far as possible with the building envelope.
15 That takes us inside.
16 Next the code addresses Building Mechanical Systems:
17 Air Conditioning
18 • Split systems
19 • Mini splits
20 • Economizers
21 • Ductwork
22 • System insulation
23 o Service Water Heating
24 o Electrical Power and Lighting

30 • The “Renovated Building” dilemma
31 • Repairing portions and systems
32 • Is Engineering, Paperwork and Calculations Required?
33
34 The “Renovated Building” Dilemma
35
36 Florida Statute 553.902 provides a definition of “Renovated building” that has been incorporated into
37 Sections C101.4.2 and R101.4.2 as well as the definitions.
38
39 F.S. 553.902(6) “Renovated building” means a residential or nonresidential building undergoing
40 alteration that varies or changes insulation, HVAC systems, water heating systems, or exterior envelope
41 conditions, if the estimated cost of renovation exceeds 30 percent of the assessed value of the structure.
42
43 Essentially, if the alterations do not exceed 30% of the assessed value of the existing structure, the rules
44 of the Energy Conservation volume do not apply. Same for Both Residential and Commercial.
45
46 C/R 101.4.2 Exempt buildings.
47
48 Buildings exempt from the provisions of the Florida Building Code, Energy Conservation, include existing
49 buildings except those considered renovated buildings, changes of occupancy type or previously
50 unconditioned buildings to which comfort conditioning is added. Exempt buildings include those specified
51 in Sections C/R101.4.2.1 through C/R101.4.2.4.
52
53 This definition provides an exemption to the requirements of the Energy Conservation volume. The
54 statutory language was incorporated into Florida law in 1992. It has been a part of the Energy Code and
55 then the Energy Conservation volume ever since.
56
57
58 This basically allows existing buildings undergoing repairs and alterations to utilize the codes in effect atFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 6 - Energy Conservation Volume

2 assessed value of the structure (not including the land).

4 Repairing Portions and Systems
5
6 Chapter 5 of the Energy Conservation volume covers Existing Buildings. This is true in both the
7 Commercial and Residential sections. Similar requirements exist in the beginning of each.
8
9 We will look at the Commercial sections and then the Residential.
10
11 C501.1 Scope.
12
13 The provisions of this chapter shall control the alteration, repair, addition and change of occupancy of
14 existing buildings and structures.
15
16 While this section seems to apply to all work on existing buildings, remember the exemption for buildings
17 that are not considered “renovated”.
18
19 C501.2 Existing buildings.
20
21 Except as specified in this chapter, this code shall not be used to require the removal, alteration, or
22 abandonment of, nor prevent the continued use and maintenance of, an existing building or building
23 system lawfully in existence at the time of adoption of this code.
24
25 This section clearly helps us to understand the intent is to allow the continuation of existing buildings and
26 we are not requiring existing buildings to replace everything in order to continue their use.

12
13 Exceptions:
14
15 • 1. Where part of a functional unit is repaired or replaced. For example, replacement of an entire
16 HVAC system is not required because a new compressor or other part does not meet code when
17 installed with an older system.
18 • 2. If the unit being replaced is itself a functional unit, such as a condenser, it does not constitute a
19 repair. Outdoor and indoor units that are not designed to be operated together must meet the
20 U.S. Department of Energy certification requirements contained in Section R303.1.2. Matched
21 systems are required; this match may be verified by any one of the following means:
22 o a) AHRI data
23 o b) Accredited laboratory
24 o c) Manufacturer’s letter
25 o d) Letter from registered P.E. State of Florida
26 • 3. Where existing components are utilized with a replacement system, such as air distribution
27 system ducts or electrical wiring for lights, such components or controls need not meet code if
28 meeting code would require that component’s replacement.
29 • 4. Replacement equipment that would require extensive revisions to other systems, equipment, or
30 elements of a building where such replacement is a like-for-like replacement, such as through-
31 the-wall condensing units and PTACs, chillers and cooling towers in confined spaces.

14
15 Section 1.03 – History
16
17 For many years there was a gray area of interpretation as to what a Licensed Pool Contractor could do
18 when performing maintenance on electrically powered pool equipment.
19
20 F.S. 489.105 (l) "Swimming pool/spa servicing contractor"
21
22 Means a contractor whose scope of work involves, but is not limited to, the repair and servicing of a
23 swimming pool, or hot tub or spa, whether public or private, or otherwise, regardless of use. The scope of
24 work includes the repair or replacement of existing equipment, any cleaning or equipment sanitizing that
25 requires at least a partial disassembling, excluding filter changes, and the installation of new pool/spa
26 equipment, interior refinishing, the reinstallation or addition of pool heaters, the repair or replacement of
27 all perimeter piping and filter piping, the repair of equipment rooms or housing for pool/spa equipment,
28 and the substantial or complete draining of a swimming pool, or hot tub or spa, for the purpose of repair
29 or renovation.
30
31 The problem is when the equipment to be installed, repaired, or replaced is connected and powered by
32 electric wires.
33
34 Who can disconnect/reconnect?
35
36 Is this within the scope of a Swimming Pool/Spa Contractor?
37
38 Is a Swimming Pool Contractor obligated to subcontract to an electrician?
39
40 The statute did not speak clearly to this.
41
42 What was allowed in one part of the state was not allowed in others based on interpretation of the same
43 statute.
44
45 Section 1.04 - The Empowering Legislation
46
47 The CILB has statutory authority to make changes to their rules.
48
49 F.S. 489.101 Purpose.
50
51 ” The Legislature deems it necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to regulate
52 the construction industry.”
53Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 7 - Swimming Pool Electrical Safety
Reicon Publishing, LLC 119
1 489.108 Rulemaking authority.
2
3 ” The board has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement the
4 provisions of this chapter conferring duties upon it.”
5
6 After many months and many meetings and much discussion between all the “stakeholders” the following
7 2 rules were developed and adopted: 61G4-12.011(16) and 61G4-18.001.
8
9 Section 1.05 - 61G4-12.011 (16)
10
11 This is the definition and part of the rules created by the Board.
12 16) Installation or repair:
13
14 “Pursuant to section 489.105(3)(j)(k)(l), F.S., the term “installation or repair” of pool/spa equipment, as it
15 pertains to swimming pool and spa electrical work, is defined as inclusive of installation, replacement,
16 disconnection or reconnection of power wiring on the load side of the dedicated existing electrical
17 disconnecting means. If installation, removal, replacement, or upgrading of this circuit is necessary, the
18 work shall be performed by a licensed electrical contractor only. Nothing in this paragraph shall be
19 deemed to restrict or limit in any manner the scope of work authorized by law of other contractor
20 classifications, or other professions.”
21
22 Purpose of rule change
23
24 To clear up ambiguity in F.S. 489.105 regarding installation & repair of existing pool equipment.
25 To align the Pool Contractors stated scope of work with what was being practiced in the field.
26 To give guidance to local building departments as to what license is appropriate to issue a permit to when
27 involving the installation & repairs of electrically powered swimming pool equipment.
28 To allow pool contractors to legally disconnect and reconnect wiring to existing pool equipment for the
29 purpose of servicing without unnecessarily raising the cost to the public.
30
31 This new rule became law and effective on 5/24/2017.
32
33 On load side of dedicated existing disconnecting means:
34
35 On the equipment side of the electrical current supply line. Downstream from electric current shutoff or
36 disconnect.
37 Disconnect be dedicated:
38 Single pole electric switch.
39 Timeclock.
40 Cartridge fuse box disconnect.
41 Circuit breaker (only for shutoff purposes, not to be repaired or replaced!!).
42
43 Section 1.06 - 61G4-158.001
44
45 As part of the negotiations and rule making process it was agreed that if swimming pool contractors are to
46 be allowed to perform minor electric work on pool equipment, some continuing education on the basics of
47 electrical maintenance & safety procedures be required.
48
49 Rule 61G4-18.001 (CE) was opened as a companion rule and amended to require swimming pool
50 contractors to complete 1 hour of CE course time on swimming pool electric topics.
51
52 The 1 hour is INCLUDED as part of the normal required 14 hours of CE every 2 years and does not
53 increase the CE course time requirement.
54
55 This rule became law on July 19, 2017, and will be enforced beginning with the CE renewal cycle
56 ending 8/31/2018.
57
58 This is in the FAC which is the Boards Rule. The rules are made by the Board based on what they are
59 directed to do by the Legislature through the statutory language. It is also important to understand the
60 Board is empowered by FS 489 to protect the public. Based on recent events, these changes wereChapter 7 - Swimming Pool Electrical Safety Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
120 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 deemed necessary.
2
3 The new rule reads:
4
5 One (1) hour shall be required in the following topic:
6
7 (g) Pool electrical requirements if license is held in the following category: Commercial pool/spa,
8 Residential pool/spa, Swimming pool/spa servicing, or Residential pool/spa servicing specialty.
9
10 Section 1.07 - Current Issues and Reasons for Electrical CE
11
12 Electrical systems are not generally well understood.
13
14 Code compliance (inspections) relies on visual inspection - lack consistency.
15
16 Poor and/or incorrect installation or maintenance.
17
18 Environments are conducive to corrosion and damage.
19
20 Issues do not stop with owner acceptance of the initial installation of the product or the end of the
21 maintenance or service call.
22
23 If you are not a trained electrician, you may not understand what is important for safety. Permits are not
24 always required, so the oversight of another set of eyes from an inspector may not occur. Pool
25 environments are conducive to corrosion and other deleterious effects on systems and equipment. Visual
26 inspection and knowledge of what is required is critical for safety.

57
58 Swimming pool construction & maintenance should be concerned with each piece of equipmentFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 7 - Swimming Pool Electrical Safety
Reicon Publishing, LLC 121
1 connected to the pool.
2
3 A swimming pool facility is an interconnected system of heaters, filters, pumps, drains and so much more,
4 which means that a swimming Pool Contractor needs to stay on top of all these devices to ensure a clean
5 & safe swimming environment.
6
7 Running a pool day after day places a great amount of strain on the devices that keep the water clean
8 and swimmers safe, and every pool manager should know just how corrosion can affect their facilities.
9
10 “Corrosion is the culprit and inspection are the only way to prevent or at least
11 control it.”
12
13 Whether constructing a new swimming pool or providing maintenance and repair of equipment, it is
14 important to choose the right materials to ensure adequate corrosion-resistance. In swimming pool
15 operations, equipment is under constant exposure to moistures and various pool chemicals, which are
16 highly corrosive.
17
18 Due to the corrosive properties of Chlorine, Muriatic Acid, salts and the weather itself the electrical
19 components of a pool are under constant attack. These system and components should be inspected
20 upon every visit whether for routine maintenance & servicing or repairing a specific part.
21
22 “Corrosion can take many forms, and correct selection of materials and finishes
23 is key to preventing each type. Follow these three steps when installing or
24 replacing electrical components: “
25
26 Select materials according to their galvanic properties. Different metals and alloys have different
27 electrode potentials. When two different metals are electrically connected in the presence of an
28 electrolyte, such as seawater, the more active metal will become anodic – losing electrons and increasing
29 its oxidation state in a process known as galvanic corrosion. Galvanic corrosion can be minimized by
30 selecting metals close together in the galvanic series.
31
32 Use protective coatings. Various finishes can be applied to help isolate metallic surfaces from the
33 surrounding corrosive environment. The most familiar example is ordinary paint applied to steel to prevent
34 rust, but there are many other methods including baked enamel, epoxy powder coat, and PVC coating.
35
36 Choose nonmetallic components. Manufacturers are increasingly offering nonmetallic products that are
37 completely impervious to the environments and substances that can corrode metals.
38
39 Section 2.04 - Impedance & Corrosion
40
41 What is impedance?
42
43 Think of the word: IMPEDE which means “to hinder”. Simply put, impedance is a number measuring the
44 resistance an electric circuit or wire to the flow of an AC electrical current.
45
46 When impedance becomes too great for a given flow of AC electrical current the result is excessive heat
47 being built up in the wire or circuit. If this heat becomes too great there is an increasing chance of fire
48 being created.
49
50 Impedance and required AC current for an electrically powered pool component is the reason why certain
51 gauge wires are specified for the connect to and from electrical components.
52
53 The fact is that corrosion will many time increase the impedance of a wire or the connections of wires to
54 the components.
55 All electrical connection to pool equipment should be checked on a regular basis. If corrosion is setting
56 in, sometimes a simple cleaning and reconnecting is all that is needed. In more severe instances, the wire
57 or connection must be replaced.
58
59 A licensed pool professional should always perform a safety inspection of the electrically poweredChapter 7 - Swimming Pool Electrical Safety Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
122 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 components of the pool for safety issues much as a car mechanic will perform a safety inspection when a
2 car is in for an oil change.
3
4 Section 2.05 - Grounding vs. Bonding
5
6 What does “Grounding” mean?
7
8 The National Electrical Code (NFPA 70) defines the word “Ground” as the earth.
9 We think of something being grounded as having a safety wire, the green conductor. It is never used
10 during normal operation; it only comes into play during a ground fault.
11 This conductor is used only in case of a ground fault and is intended only to carry current long enough to
12 clear an overcurrent device. The bonding conductor is always carrying voltage and/or current.
13
14 Ground to the earth.
15
16 Ground Fault: An unintentional, electrically conducting connection between an ungrounded conductor of
17 an electrical circuit and the normally non–current-carrying conductors, metallic enclosures, metallic
18 raceways, metallic equipment, or earth.
19 Grounded (Grounding): Connected (connecting) to ground or to a conductive body that extends the
20 ground connection.
21 Grounded, Solidly: Connected to ground without inserting any resistor or impedance device.
22 Grounded Conductor: A system or circuit conductor that is intentionally grounded.
23
24 A ground fault is not a short circuit!
25
26 A short circuit is when the wires intended to be part of the circuit touch each other, and generally go
27 boom!!
28 A ground fault is when electricity goes through an unintended path, such as the case of the motor, or
29 you. The ground wire is used to carry to carry this current, referred to as fault or overcurrent, we hope, in
30 order to open the fuse or circuit breaker ahead of the circuit This is referred to as clearing the fault or
31 opening the overcurrent device.
32 A bond wire is always carrying voltage and current because it is making sure there is no difference of
33 potential between the connected items. That is why it is bigger, and it will protect you, if you, and your
34 customer, make sure it is in place, the right size and properly connected.
35
36 Section 2.06 - Why Do We Ground Items?
37
38 This is a ground fault. It is important you understand these concepts and theories. The topics below,
39 show what they are, and how a ground fault is being created, not a short circuit.
40 To clear ground faults.
41 Grounding is not related to a short circuit.
42 A ground fault is an unintended path.
43 A GFCI would protect this individual!
44 A breaker or fuse will not!

2 Section 2.07 - Why Do We Bond Items?
3
4 Bonding is one of the most important items around pools. All the metal around the electrical service
5 is bonded to the neutral for protection and ensures stability of the voltage once attached to earth. All
6 metal piping systems including water, metal ducts, building steel and numerous other items, are bonded
7 to prevent arcing, sparking, and limit shock hazards. Tying everything together prevents voltages
8 traveling between the various services, protecting the users of the systems.
9
10 It eliminates voltage gradients.
11 Very simply, for safety!
12 It eliminates voltage differences.
13 It is required by the governing Codes.
14 It prevents shock hazards from developing.
15
16 Bonding the Pump Motor
17
18 If not done, this is a blatant violation and life safety hazard!
19 It must be installed initially by electrician.
20 Pool contractors must inspect, maintain, and repair if necessary.
21 Critical to proper safety.
22 Pool contractors must check for integrity during every visit.
23
24 The importance of bonding and grounding in swimming pools, equipment, deck
25 and adjacent structures and cannot be overstated.
26
27 The grounded circuits of electrically powered pumps and equipment need to
28 have an effective return path from the equipment to the power source in
29 order to function properly.
30
31 In addition, non-current-carrying metallic components in a swimming pool
32 facility, such as structural steel, ladders, slides, diving boards and screen
33 enclosures need to be electrically interconnected so voltage potential cannot
34 exist between them.
35
36 Section 2.08 - The Mysterious GFCI
37
38 A GFCI is a simple device. It stands for Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter and will
39 not clear a short circuit.
40
41 It monitors the hot and neutral for any imbalance in current. The imbalance can be on the hot or neutral.
42
43 Often consumers do not understand them, and they also think it has an effect when someone is caught
44 between the hot and neutral. A GFCI ONLY detects ground faults and that needs to be stressed. A
45 ground fault is when EITHER the hot or neutral current is diverted from the circuit conductors through an
46 alternate path.
47
48 If for example, a person contacts the hot or neutral wire and conducts a flow of electricity to earth, the
49 current transformer shown in the diagram (shown on the next slide) senses a difference of electrical flow
50 between the hot and neutral. When this flow exceeds the 5-mA threshold, the device “trips” and
51 disconnects the hot and neutral conductor from the circuit to protect the person.
52
53 Notice in the diagram, the test button simulates the same type of scenario previously mentioned and
54 should be tested once a month, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

3 GFCI vs. AFCI
4
5 Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCI) help prevent burns, electric shocks, and electrocution. A
6 GFCI has sensors that measure the current going out and the current coming back in. Normally, the
7 current is balanced as it goes out and comes back in.
8 However, if the current is out of balance, something is wrong. The electric current has contacted a
9 human, or somewhere else it should not be.
10
11 The GFCI senses this and instantly shuts down the circuit, stopping the flow of electricity. Since water is
12 an excellent electric conductor, GFCIs are important in areas where water and electricity could meet,
13 such as bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms and garages.
14
15 GFCI vs. AFCI
16
17 Arc Fault Circuit Interrupters (AFCI) help prevent electric fires. An AFCI should never be installed in
18 place of or as a substitute for a GFCI.
19
20 Electricity can leak out of damaged or decaying wires and start a fire. These fires spread quickly in the
21 wiring behind walls. Electric fires cause more damage than other types of fire and are twice as deadly.
22 AFCIs sense that electricity is leaking from the electric system and shut electricity off before overheating
23 happens.
24
25 Basically, GFCIs prevent shocks, and AFCIs prevent fires. By law BOTH MUST be installed by a
26 qualified electrician.

28 Section 2.09 - Relevant Codes, Standards, & Definitions
29
30 Relevant Standards: NEC – Article 680
31
32 This is the section of the electrical code that requires the bonding of metal items. This applies to motors,
33 lights, both in and out of the pool, metal windows, metal doors, screen enclosures and basically anything
34 metal that is in, on or around the pool that could possibly become energized. Yes, even the copper
35 shower located on the pool deck if it is within 5 feet.

10 “A ‘Swimming Pool Private’ means any structure, located in a residential area, that is intended for
11 swimming or recreational bathing and contains water over 24 inches deep, including, but not limited to,
12 in-ground, above-ground, and on-ground swimming pools; hot tubs; and non-portable spas.”
13
14 Earlier we discussed what a pool might be. The Florida Building Code has one definition, and the National
15 Electrical Code has a different definition.
16
17 This is problematic if you do not understand why. The Building Code has specific concerns for safety as
18 does the electrical code. Electrically, we need to be incredibly careful around bodies of water that contain
19 minerals, dissolved solids and other chemicals.
20
21 The electrical code rules when those regulations apply, and the building code governs when
22 those definitions apply.
23
24 A “public swimming pool” or “public pool” means a single watertight structure of concrete, masonry
25 or other approved materials that is located either indoors or outdoors, used for bathing or swimming by
26 humans, and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, together with buildings, appurtenances
27 and equipment used in connection therewith. A public swimming pool or public pool shall mean a
28 conventional pool, spa-type pool, wading pool, special purpose pool, interactive water feature or water
29 recreation attraction, to which admission may be gained with or without payment of a fee and includes,
30 but is not limited to, pools operated by or serving camps, churches, cities, counties, day care centers,
31 group home facilities for eight or more clients, health spas, institutions, parks, state agencies, schools,
32 subdivisions, or the cooperative living-type projects of five or more living units, such as apartments,
33 boardinghouses, hotels, mobile home parks, motels, recreational vehicle parks, and townhouses. The
34 term does not include a swimming pool located on the grounds of a private residence.
35
36 The Definition of a Pool
37
38 SWIMMING POOL. Any structure, basin, chamber, or tank containing an artificial body of water for
39 swimming, diving or recreational bathing located in a residential area serving four or fewer living units
40 having a depth of 2 feet (610 mm) or more at any point as defined in Section 515.25, Florida Statutes, or
41 the body of water is a public pool as defined in Section 514.011, Florida Statutes.

2
3 As a service technician, it is imperative that you be the expert to protect your customer and their friends.
4 You have a responsibility to look at the overall system. If you see problems or concerns, it should be
5 noted. If it is a life safety threat, other actions may be required.
6
7 Items of Concerns
8
9 • Pumps  Receptacles
10 • Lighting  Disconnects.
11 • Around the pool  Wiring methods
12 • In the pool  Corrosion
13
14 Section 3.02 - Is a Permit Required?
15
16 Florida Building Code – Building - Section 105.1 Permit Required.
17
18 The code goes on to say that with the permission of the building official, minor repairs not impacting
19 safety may be done without a permit.
20
21 Some areas have a published list of what is allowed to be done without permits. In other areas, you need
22 to contact the building department to find out if a permit is required.
23
24 Regardless of whether a permit is required or not, code compliance is required by section 102.2 of
25 Chapter 1 of the Florida Building Code - Building.
26
27 Section 3.03 - Inspecting the System & Identifying the Parts
28
29 Pumps
30
31 Virtually ALL pool, spa, fountain, hydro-massage, and so on type pumps require GFCI protection. Make
32 sure they are working, push the button and record it on the ticket.
33
34 Code requirements are based solely on safety. Manufacturer’s instructions must also be followed. Pumps
35 REQUIRE a minimum #12 equipment ground wire. Most pumps also require connection to the bonding
36 grid by a #8 solid copper conductor. The connection of these 2 conductors is a life safety requirement.
37 While the GFCI would seem to be sufficient for the safety of the overall system, this is the belt and
38 suspenders approach to assuring safety and proper operation.
39
40 GFCI Receptacle
41
42 The GFCI may be a receptacle, a circuit breaker, or even a GFCI protector. If
43 any portions of the protective systems are found to be missing or non-
44 operational, they should be noted and be sure to tell the owner. Never by-
45 pass or remove it.
46
47 If these items affect the life safety portion of the overall system, such as a
48 missing bond wire or GFCI that does not test properly, DO NOT TURN ON
49 THE SYSTEM and advise the owner that an electrician is required before
50 energizing. Always make sure the pump is grounded and bonded.
51
52 Be aware: the energy code may require a 2-speed motor.

3 Be aware of and know how to find and reference each of these NEC sections:
4
5 680.6 Grounding
6 680.11 Equipment Rooms and Pits
7 680.12 Maintenance Disconnecting Means
8 680.21 Motors Requirements
9
10 1) General: The branch circuits for pool-associated motors shall be installed in rigid metal conduit,
11 intermediate metal conduit, rigid polyvinyl chloride conduit, reinforced thermosetting resin conduit, or
12 Type MC cable listed for the location. Other wiring methods and materials shall be permitted in specific
13 locations or applications as covered in this section. Any wiring method employed shall contain an
14 insulated copper equipment grounding conductor sized in accordance with 250.122 but not smaller than
15 12 AWG.
16
17 680.21 Motor Requirements
18
19 No matter the wiring method, the electrical code does not want to rely on the wiring method for the ground
20 fault return path. The required #12 insulated copper conductor, run with the circuit conductors, ensures a
21 low impedance path to clear any ground faults and, will hopefully be a lower resistance than any person
22 or other connection that may interfere with clearing the fault. Clearing the fault, means tripping the circuit
23 breaker or blowing the fuse.
24
25 The other code section referred to here, 250.122, is a table in the electrical code that provides the size of
26 the required equipment grounding conductor based on the size of the fuse or circuit breaker.

32 A representation of wire sizes. There will be writing on the insulation indicating the size. Verify it!
33
34
35
36 On or Within Buildings: Where installed on or within buildings, electrical metallic tubing shall be
37 permitted.
38 Flexible Connections: Where necessary to employ flexible connections at or adjacent to the motor,
39 liquid tight flexible metal or liquid tight flexible nonmetallic conduit with approved fittings shall be
40 permitted.
41
42 It is often necessary to provide a flexible connection for the electric supply going to the motor. This
43 prevents the transmission of vibrations and helps ensure the ongoing integrity of the electrical connection.
44 Whatever acceptable wiring method is used, remember to be sure to use the proper fittings. Fittings for
45 these wiring methods are listed for specific types, such as metallic or non-metallic and type A or type B.

11 Double Insulated Motor Bonding Requirement
12
13 Double insulated means the pump has an extra layer of protection and all the electrical parts are located
14 within a non-conductive housing. This means you can’t touch any of the electrical parts. The symbol will
15 be found on the nameplate.
16
17 A listed cord-and-plug connected pool pump incorporating an approved system
18 of double insulation that provides a means for grounding only the internal and
19 non-accessible, non–current-carrying metal parts of the pump shall be
20 connected to any wiring method recognized in Chapter 3 that is suitable for the
21 location. Where the bonding grid is connected to the equipment grounding
22 conductor of the motor circuit in accordance with the second sentence of
23 680.26(B)(6)(a), the branch-circuit wiring shall comply with 680.21(A).
24
25 A bonding wire does not have to be connected to the motor itself if the motor is
26 double insulated and the cord and plug to the motor is grounded properly.
27

30 (C) GFCI Protection. Outlets supplying pool pump motors connected to single-phase, 120 volt through
31 240-volt branch circuits, rated 15 or 20 amperes, whether by receptacle or by direct connection, shall be

42
43 680.23: Underwater Luminaires
44
45 Lighting in and around pools has always been popular. The hazard for lighting in
46 and around pools has always been a concern. In some cases, especially indoors, we may also have
47 ceiling lights and/or ceiling fans. We need to be sure if these are close to the pool, they are bonded and
48 protected by GFCI. There are locations that are prohibited from having these items. In any case, they
49 need to be listed for the use and location.

1 Wet-Niche Luminaire
2
3 A wet niche is currently the most common type of fixture and requires a bond
4 in the niche that attached to the bonding grid. As we move more and more to
5 LED, the next types of fixtures will reduce electrical consumption and the way
6 they are installed.
7
8 Understand the difference! Even if a wet niche is changed to an LED, the
9 bonding of the niche is required.

11 Dry-Niche Luminaire
12
13 Dry niche luminaires are dry and gasketed, they do not contact pool water.
14
15 No-Niche Luminaire
16
17 This style penetrates the entire shell with a waterproof housing. All service is done from the rear or
18 requires the pool to be drained for service!
19
20 Through-Wall Lighting Assembly
21
22 For through wall installations, a professionally installed pool transformer is still required.
23
24 Remember That Bonding Discussion?
25
26 NEC 680.23(5) Luminaire Bonding: The luminaire shall be bonded to, and secured to, the forming shell
27 by a positive locking device that ensures a low resistance contact and requires a tool to remove the
28 luminaire from the forming shell. Bonding shall not be required for luminaires that are listed for the
29 application and have not non–current-carrying metal parts.
30
31 Note the wording here. We are counting on this connection to be sure the ring is bonded and grounded.
32 This may also serve as our water bond for the pool water. We need to ensure a low impedance
33 connection - no tie wraps!

36
37 NEC 680.22 Lighting, Receptacles, and Equipment
38
39 (A) Receptacles.
40
41 1. Required Receptacle, Location. Where a permanently installed pool is installed at a dwelling unit(s),
42 no fewer than one 125-volt, 15-or 20-ampere receptacle on a general-purpose branch circuit shall be
43 located not less than 1.83 m (6 ft.) from, and not more than 6.0 m (20 ft.) from, the inside wall of the pool.
44 This receptacle shall be located not more than 2.0 m (6 ft. 6 in.) above the floor, platform, or grade level
45 serving the pool.
46
47 2. Circulation and Sanitation System, Location. Receptacles that provide power for water-pump
48 motors or for other loads directly related to the circulation and sanitation system shall be located at least
49 3.0 m (10 ft.) from the inside walls of the pool, or not less than 1.83 m (6 ft.) from the inside walls of the
50 pool if they meet all of the following conditions:
51 Consist of single receptacles.
52
53 • Employ a locking configuration.
54 • Are of the grounding type.
55 • Have GFCI protection.
56
57
58 The general rule is to hard wire the pump. If the pump is connected by way of a receptacle and cord cap,Chapter 7 - Swimming Pool Electrical Safety Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
130 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 it must meet these requirements.
2
3 3. Other Receptacles, Location. Other receptacles shall be not less than 1.83 m (6 ft.) from the inside
4 walls of a pool.
5
6 Where a pool is installed at a dwelling unit, not fewer than one receptacle shall be located not less than
7 6ft. and not more than 20 ft. from the inside wall of the pool. This outlet must not be more than 6ft. 6
8 inches above the floor, platform or grade level serving the pool.
9
10 4. GFCI Protection. All 15- and 20-amp, single phase, 125-volt receptacles located within 6.0 m (20 ft.) of
11 the inside walls of the pool shall be protected by a ground-fault circuit interrupter.
12
13 5. Measurements. In determining the dimensions in this section addressing receptacle spacings, the
14 distance to be measured shall be the shortest path the supply cord of an appliance connected to the
15 receptacle would follow without piercing a floor, wall, ceiling, doorway with hinged or sliding door, window
16 opening, or another effective permanent barrier.

26 safety, public health, and general welfare through structural strength, means of egress in facilities,
27 stability, sanitation, adequate light and ventilation, energy conservation, and safety to life and property
28 from fire and other hazards attributed to the built environment and to provide a reasonable level of safety
29 to fire fighters and emergency responders during emergency operations.
30
31 In general, the purpose of the building code is to provide public safety and safety of the emergency
32 officers in case of fire or any other catastrophic situations. The building code is the minimum standard of
33 construction. The safety of the building is to give any one trapped or rescuers 60 minutes to get out of the
34 building.

8 Existing Building Definition
9
10 When is a building considered “existing”? The FBC-Existing Building volume provides guidance with the
11 following definition:
12
13 Chapter 2, Section 202 General Definitions
14
15 [A] Existing Building. A building erected prior to the date of adoption of the appropriate code, or one for
16 which a legal building permit has been issued.
17
18 There are some stipulations to the interpretation of this rule. Just because a building exists does not
19 make it legal. Just because a building exists does make it occupiable. Just because a building exists does
20 not mean it is being used as intended.
21
22 Rules governing occupancy can be found in Chapter 1, Sections 101.4.1, .2, and 101.7 outlined later in
23 this chapter.
24
25 CHAPTER 1 SCOPE AND ADMINISTRATION
26
27 101 General
28
29 101.1 Title
30
31 These regulations shall be known as the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, hereinafter referred to
32 as “this code.” In addition to the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of Chapter 1, Florida Building
33 Code, Building, shall govern the administration and enforcement of this code.
34
35 101.2 Scope
36
37 The provisions of this code shall apply to the construction, alteration, movement, enlargement,
38 replacement, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, location, maintenance, removal, and demolition of
39 every building or structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or structures.
40
41 Exceptions:
42
43 Detached one- and two-family dwellings and multiple single-family dwellings (town houses) not more than
44 three stories above grade plane in height with a separate means of egress and their accessory structures
45 shall comply with the Florida Building Code, Residential.
46 Existing buildings undergoing repair, alterations or additions and change of occupancy shall be permitted
47 to comply with the Florida Building Code, Existing Building.

3 Provisions in the appendices shall not apply unless specifically adopted. [FBC-Building]
4
5 [A] 101.4 Applicability
6
7 This code shall apply to the repair, alteration, change of occupancy, addition, and relocation of existing
8 buildings, regardless of occupancy, subject to the criteria of Sections 101.4.1 and 101.4.2.
9
10 [A] 101.4.1 Buildings Not Previously Occupied
11
12 A building or portion of a building that has not been previously occupied or used for its intended purpose
13 in accordance with the laws in existence at the time of its completion shall be permitted to comply with the
14 provisions of the laws in existence at the time of its original permit unless such permit has expired.
15 Subsequent permits shall comply with the Florida Building Code, Building or Florida Building Code,
16 Residential, as applicable, for new construction.
17
18 Commentary: This section makes it clear that a building under construction when the code changes is
19 permitted to continue under construction based on the approved plans and permits. Changes to the new
20 code do not affect this construction as it is underway. A building that was not completed and has allowed
21 the permit to expire is different.
22
23 If the building was not completed, the permit expired, and the building never received a Certificate of
24 Occupancy, meaning it has not been used for the intended purpose, a new permit in compliance with the
25 code in effect at the time of application is required, This section further makes it clear that a building not
26 used for the intended purpose is also considered NOT previously occupied. This could be a building
27 constructed as a mercantile, Group M, and then used for assembly purposes, Group A, as an example. It
28 was not designed or constructed for that use.
29
30 [A] 101.4.2 Buildings Previously Occupied
31
32 The legal occupancy of any building existing on the date of adoption of this code shall be permitted to
33 continue without change, except as is specifically covered in this code, the Florida Fire Prevention Code,
34 or as is deemed necessary by the code official for the general safety and welfare of the occupants and
35 the public.
36
37 Commentary: Buildings that are in use and being used as intended are permitted to continue in that use.
38 This is the reason for the Existing Building volume. Just because the code has been updated, we do not
39 go through communities and require that each building be reconstructed. This is not only unfair; it is
40 unreasonable and costly.
41
42 [A] 101.5 Safeguards During Construction
43
44 Construction work covered in this code, including any related demolition, shall comply with the
45 requirements of Chapter 15.
46
47 [A] 101.6 Appendices
48
49 Reserved.
50
51 [A] 101.7 Correction of Violations of Other Codes
52
53 Repairs or alterations mandated by any property, housing, or fire safety maintenance code or mandated
54 by any licensing rule or ordinance adopted pursuant to law shall conform only to the requirements of that
55 code, rule, or ordinance and shall not be required to conform to this code unless the code requiring such
56 repair or alteration so provides.
57
58
59 Commentary: This and 101.4.2 that allows buildings to continue in use make several things clear. We do
60 not intend to apply the current edition of the code to existing buildings. A building being used as intendedFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 8 - Know Your Building Code! : FBC-Existing Building
Reicon Publishing, LLC 163
1 can continue to operate in the capacity for which it was originally designed, this is true even if the current
2 edition of the code would require something different, such as the addition of fire sprinklers. If there are
3 items found in other codes, rules, or laws they are not required by this volume and are not to be applied
4 as if they were. Existing violations of life safety that may be present and discovered during alterations are
5 to be cited to the owner.
6
7 Often during an alteration or repair, existing violations of the codes are uncovered. Some of these may be
8 accidental or inadvertent. Some may have been caused by previous owners or tenants. The contractor
9 making the repairs or alterations may have been unaware of any issues. It may be outside of their
10 contract. Unless there is a life safety issue, those items found must be cited independently of any work
11 being performed.
12
13 101.8 Existing Mechanical Equipment
14
15 An agency or local government may not require that existing mechanical equipment located on or above
16 the surface of a roof be installed in compliance with the requirements of the Florida Building Code except
17 during reroofing when the equipment is being replaced or moved and is not in compliance with the
18 provisions of the Florida Building Code relating to roof-mounted mechanical units.
19
20 CHAPTER 5 6 CLASSIFICATION OF WORK
21
22 Alterations
23
24 An alteration can be defined as, any construction or renovation to an existing structure other than repair
25 or addition. Alterations are broken down into three categories, Levels 1, 2, and 3.
26
27 When doing an alteration, it is important to define the work area.
28
29 Work Area. A work area is that portion or portions of a building consisting of all reconfigured spaces as
30 indicated on the construction documents. A work area excludes other portions of the building where
31 incidental work entailed by the intended work must be performed and portions of the building where work
32 not initially intended by the owner is specifically required by this code.
33
34 503602.1 Alteration – Level 1 Scope
35
36 Level 1 alterations include the Removal and replacement, or covering of existing materials, elements
37 equipment, and or fixtures using new materials, elements, equipment, or fixtures that serve the same
38 purpose
39 Does not include reconfiguration of space
40
41 Commentary: Typically, the component (delegate) engineer (such as engineering companies who are
42 building component design engineers) serves as the only engineer for this level alteration and do not
43 need to provide host reactions for others or require shop drawing approval. Since there is typically no
44 architect or engineer above the component engineer, the component engineer produces work either at
45 the master plan sheet (non-site specific) level or addresses a site-specific condition with the assistance of
46 the permitting contractor to develop a code compliant solution.
47
48 504603.1 Alteration – Level 2 Scope
49
50 Level 2 alterations include the Reconfiguration of spaces, the addition or elimination of any door or
51 window, the reconfiguration or extension of any system, or the installation of additional system.
52 Reconfiguration of spaces (i.e., removal and addition of walls that could alter paths of egress
53 The addition or elimination of any door or window
54 Reconfiguration or extension of any system or installation of new equipment such as HVAC, electrical,
55 plumbing systems, etc.
56 Requirements for improvements or upgrade outside the scope of work exist in this category
57 Full compliance with the Code for new construction is not required
58 Applies where the work area is less than 50% of the aggregate area of the building
59Chapter 8 - Know Your Building Code! : FBC-Existing Building Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
164 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 Commentary: Typically, there is an architect and/or engineer of record (AOR/EOR) on level 2 alterations
2 that receives the component engineers’ information for approval and incorporation in their design.
3 Component engineers cannot make the final decisions on design work and are subject to AOR/EOR
4 review and approval. The contractor typically facilitates coordination between trades, but at times the
5 component engineers work directly with the AOR/EOR for approval. Notes and disclaimers exist on the
6 component engineers’ plans to ensure compliance and limited liability that they are serving as component
7 engineers. In cases where there is no AOR/EOR, the commentary from level 1 applies.
8
9 505 604.1 Alteration – Level 3 Scope
10
11 Level 3 alterations apply Alteration Level 3 is just like level 2 alteration except where the work area
12 exceeds 50% of the aggregate building area of the building (total floors area).
13 Triggers in this classification are work that potentially affects the building’s fire protections systems,
14 vertical openings, means of egress, accessibility, and structural system.
15
16 Commentary: The notes from level 2 commentary apply with the exception that there would nearly
17 always be an AOR/EOR at this alteration level. Building component engineers would not engage fully in a
18 project of this alteration level and serve exclusively as the component engineer.
19
20 So, essentially, Level 1 is replacement, Level 2 is replacement with changes, and Level 3 is a major
21 remodeling.
22
23 CHAPTER 6 4 REPAIRS
24
25 The concept of repairs is simple; an item is not working as originally intended, it is broken, and we want it
26 to work again
27
28 The definition of repair from Chapter 2, Section 202 is as follows:
29
30 [A] Repair. The reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing building for the purpose of its
31 maintenance or to correct damage.
32
33 It is important to note this does not state “replace.” A repair is intended to allow an existing portion of a
34 building or structure to perform as it was originally intended.
35
36 Chapter 6 4 of the Existing Building volume provides additional guidance. One of the important sections
37 for a repair is 601.2 401.2.
38
39 601.2 401.2 Conformance
40
41 The work shall not make the building any less compliant conforming than it was before the repair was
42 made undertaken.
43
44 Section 602 402 provides for the materials used for repairs.

37 Knowing how and where to turn off or reset an electric breaker or replace a fuse. All systems need a
38 method of being shut off from the supply.
39
40 Every building was required to have a main water shut-off valve installed inside the home during initial
41 construction. So, for most emergencies or repairs, shutting off the proper inside valve is as important as
42 knowing how and where to shut off a buildings main water supply. There are also underground shut-off
43 valves installed at the property line; if shutting off this valve is necessary.Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 8 - Know Your Building Code! : FBC-Plumbing
Reicon Publishing, LLC 169
1 Background
2
3 It is important to understand that different plumbing arrangements will dictate where the proper main
4 supply valve is located, such as the following:
5
6 Some buildings have the water meter located inside, while others are located outside, underground within
7 a “pit” at or near the property line or right-of-way. Some homes also have submeters that are typically
8 inside even if the main meter is outside/underground.
9 Newer homes have fire sprinkler systems, while older ones generally do not.
10 Home construction also differs greatly as in basements, crawlspaces, and slab-on-grade.
11 Water shut-off valves may have round “wheel” handles or lever handles.
12
13 Locating the Proper Valve
14
15 Basements: The shut-off valve is typically located near the front foundation wall. The main water may
16 have come through the concrete floor or through the wall. The valve is typically within 3-5 feet of where
17 the main water enters. In some cases, the main water may enter in a different area, like a mechanical
18 room, up through the floor, or near the water heater or furnace.
19
20 Crawlspace with no basement: The shut off valve will typically be located near the water heater or
21 under the kitchen sink, but anywhere is possible. As mentioned above, it may be inside the crawlspace; in
22 which case, you may want to consider a secondary valve located up in the living space (near the water
23 heater or under a sink).
24
25 Slab-on-grade construction: The shut-off valve will typically be located near the water heater or under
26 the kitchen sink, but anywhere is possible.
27
28 Choosing the Proper Valve to Operate
29
30 If a home has a fire sprinkler system, care is needed when selecting a shut-off valve. Unless it is a
31 sprinkler pipe that is leaking, you should only shut off the home’s plumbing supply and leave the sprinkler
32 piping charged/live.
33
34 If the water shutdown is for a broken sprinkler line or sprinkler head, then locate the first valve (closest to
35 the main water line entry point) and operate that valve as described below.
36 For all other general plumbing shut offs, emergency, and non-emergency:
37
38 For homes with fire sprinklers and an inside main water meter, locate and operate the second valve, it will
39 be above the main meter and past (downstream) of the fire sprinkler system “tee.” If you have a
40 submeter, its second valve will only isolate the irrigation and/or hose bibs.
41 For homes with fire sprinklers and an outside main water meter, locate and operate the second valve, it
42 will be past (downstream) of the fire sprinkler “tee.”
43 For homes without fire sprinklers and with an inside main water meter, either valve will shut off the supply
44 to the home but operating the second valve is a good practice and a safeguard if you are unsure of
45 whether the home has fire sprinklers or not.
46 For homes without fire sprinklers and with an outside main water meter, there will likely only be one shut-
47 off valve that will shut down the entire home.Chapter 8 - Know Your Building Code! : FBC-Plumbing Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle

1 Backflow
2
3 A backflow preventer is a device that’s installed on a home’s water pipes that allows water to flow in one
4 direction but never in the opposite direction. Its sole job is to prevent drinking water from being
5 contaminated due to backflow.
6
7 How Backflow Happens
8
9 When water enters a home from the main water supply line, it should only ever flow in one direction - into
10 a home.
11
12 But sometimes, due to pressure changes in the pipes, that water can actually flow backwards and seep
13 back into the main water supply line.
14
15 For example, backflow can happen when there’s a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is
16 opened for use. Because pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward
17 into the home and will flow backwards into the city water lines. When this happens, backflow can
18 contaminate the public drinking supply with:
19
20 • Fertilizers/pesticides
21 • Human waste
22 • Chlorine from pools/spas
23 • Soap from sinks/dishwashers/showers
24
25 That’s where a backflow prevention system comes in handy. Let’s take a closer look at how a backflow
26 prevention system works.
27
28 Backflow Prevention System
29
30 Backflow prevention systems are devices installed onto a pipe that only allow water to flow in one
31 direction. Think of it as a one-way gate that allows water from the city’s public water supply to flow into a
32 home’s piping but stops water when it tries to flow backwards into the main water supply.
33
34 The parts you can’t see are described below.
35
36 Every habitable dwelling, and most commercial buildings have at least two plumbing systems, a potable
37 water supply and a drainage waste system (also called a drain, waste, and vent system). The potable
38 water supply system is used to deliver water to a building and to the fixtures within that building.
39
40 Once that water is used, and sent down the drain, the drainage and waste system are in charge of
41 disposing it; usually via the municipal sewage treatment system, or a septic system.
42
43 Supply lines: Water supply lines are installed for the purpose of supplying fresh water into the building.
44 In a bathroom, water supply line means connecting plumbing fixtures with the main water distribution line
45 of the building with pipes, so that water can reach them.
46
47 Federal law enacted in January 2014, requires pipe, pipe fittings, joints, valves, faucets, and fixture
48 fittings that are used to supply water for drinking or cooking to have not more than 25% lead content and
49 must comply with NSF 372.
50
51 Drains: Drainage is the method of removing surface or sub-surface water from a given area. Drainage
52 systems include all of the piping within a private or public property that conveys sewage, rainwater, and
53 other liquid waste to a point of disposal. The main objective of a drainage system is to collect and remove
54 waste matter systematically to maintain healthy conditions in a building. Drainage systems are designed
55 to dispose of wastewater as quickly as possible and should prevent gases from sewers and septic tanks
56 from entering residential areas.
57
58 The drain system within a home, works entirely by gravity, allowing wastewater to flow downhill through a
59 series of large diameter pipes. These drainpipes are connected to a vent pipe system that bring fresh air
60 to the drainpipes, preventing suction that would either stop or slow the free flow of wastewater. Vent pipesFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 8 - Know Your Building Code! : FBC-Plumbing
Reicon Publishing, LLC 171
1 exit the building through one or more roof vents. Care must be taken to ensure that these roof vents do
2 not become clogged. Leaves and bird nests are two ways in which these roof vents can become clogged.
3
4 All wastewater flows to the main waste and vent stack. The main stack curves to become a sewer line
5 that exits the building near the foundation. In a municipal system, this is a sewer line. Where sewer
6 service is not available, the line runs to a septic system that is simply a mini-wastewater treatment facility.
7
8 • Traps: A plumbing drain trap is designed to retain a small amount of water each time the sink
9 drains, and this water standing in the bottom of the curved portion of the trap seals the drain and
10 keeps sewer gasses from escaping the drain and entering the home. The following types of traps
11 are prohibited:
12 o Traps that depend on moving parts to maintain the seal
13 o Bell traps
14 o Crown-vented traps
15 o Traps not integral with a fixture and that depend on interior partitions for the seal, except
16 those traps constructed of an approved material that is resistant to corrosion and degradation
17 o “S” traps
18 o Drum traps
19 ▪ Exception: Drum traps used as solids interceptors and drum traps serving
20 chemical waste systems shall not be prohibited.
21 o Each fixture trap shall have a liquid seal of not less than 2 inches (51 mm) and not more than
22 4 inches (102 mm), or deeper for special designs relating to accessible fixtures.
23
24 Sewer: Every building in which plumbing fixtures are installed and premises having drainage piping shall
25 be connected to a publicly owned or investor-owned sewage system, where available, or an approved
26 onsite sewage treatment and disposal system in accordance with F.A.C. 64E-6, Standards for Onsite
27 Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems.

19 THE EVOLUTION OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
20
21 The Roman Empire first used lead and clay pipes for portable water that serviced private homes,
22 amphitheaters, and bathhouses throughout their empire. Lead was used throughout the United States for
23 water services that serviced homes and businesses up until the beginning of WWII. The fact that lead
24 was very flexible and extremely durable made it an ideal piping material. The use of lead for potable
25 water declined after WWII because of the dangers of lead poisoning. Lead pipes are no longer used and
26 are still being replaced to this day in some of our larger older cities across the U.S.
27
28 Federal law enacted in January 2014, requires pipes, pipe fittings, joints, valves, faucets, and fixture
29 fittings that are used to supply water for drinking or cooking have not more than 25% lead content.
30
31 Common Plumbing Materials
32
33 The following materials are commonly used in the plumbing trade.
34
35 Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): Of the different types of plastic pipe used for water supply, PVC has a wide
36 variety of plumbing uses, from drainage pipe to water mains. It is most commonly used for irrigation
37 piping, home and building supply piping, and pool and spa systems. PVC is often white, but it can also
38 come in other colors. You can often tell what it is used for by the colors and mark on the pipe. For
39 example, purple pipe with black lettering is used for reclaimed water. PVC also comes in a variety of
40 thicknesses called schedules. Schedule 40 is the most common for water distribution.
41
42 Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC): It is often (but not always) a cream-colored or off-white plastic.
43 This type of pipe can stand temperatures up to about 180 degrees F or so (this depends on the
44 schedule), so it and can be used for hot and cold water inside of a house or mobile home. Since CPVC is
45 the same outside diameter as copper and PEX, the same push-fit fittings, such as SharkBite, will fit the
46 CPVC piping.
47
48 As with PVC, you should use primer and glue when making a CPVC joint. Also, make sure the glue you
49 are using says that is can be used on CPVC. This glue is usually a different color, such as orange, so you
50 know that it is used for CPVC. There are also "universal" pipe glues that are designed to work with many
51 different types of plastic pipe.
52
53 Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX): PEX is commonly used for hot and cold water in homes, and for
54 hydronic heating systems, such as radiant under-floor systems due to its resistance to hot and cold
55 temperatures. PEX is widely used for its competitive pricing, ease of use, and the long rolls of piping that
56 it can come in. PEX can be joined in many different ways including push-fit fittings and specialty PEX
57 tools used with crimp rings to secure the joints.
58
59 This type of pipe is mostly used for hot and cold-water distribution, as well as being regularly used inFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 8 - Know Your Building Code! : FBC-Plumbing
Reicon Publishing, LLC 177
1 HVAC systems for refrigerant lines. Although once used in gas piping, this is no longer allowed in most
2 jurisdictions.
3
4 Copper: Copper piping works in both underground and above-ground applications, but copper can be
5 affected by some soils and should be sleeved if used underground. Due to the price of copper and longer
6 labor needed to install it, many builders are switching to alternative water distributions piping, such as
7 PEX.
8
9 Copper comes in different thicknesses that are labeled M, L, and K, with M being the thinnest. Copper
10 pipes can be connected in different ways, including compression fittings or with a torch so you can sweat
11 solder it.

5 IDENTIFYING PARTS OF THE SYSTEM
6
7 HVAC
8
9 Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC): refers to the different systems used for moving air
10 between indoor and outdoor areas, along with heating and cooling both residential and commercial
11 buildings. They are the systems that keep you warm and cozy in the winter and feeling cool and fresh in
12 the summer. They also filter and clean indoor air to keep you healthy and maintain humidity levels at
13 optimal comfort levels.
14
15 HVAC is a common term that people use, and most have a general idea of what it's referring to. On the
16 other hand, how does HVAC work?
17
18 Air Handlers
19
20 An air handler's main function is to circulate the air in the system, and the components surrounding it alter
21 the functionalities of heating, cooling, and air quality.
22
23 Although there are multiple ways and places you can install an air handler, the unit connects to the rest of
24 the home through a series of supply and return ventilation ducts that recirculate the air in each room.
25
26 Air handlers can be paired with an air conditioner, heat pump, and sometimes even a mini split system for
27 both heating and cooling functions. Additionally, air handlers can also be equipped with a heating coil to
28 provide supplementary heat.
29
30 Components of an Air Handler
31
32 Just like a furnace, air handlers contain a blower (fan), controls, and an evaporator coil that conditions
33 and recirculates the air in a home. The air handler works with the outdoor unit (a condenser or heat
34 pump) in a typical split system by using refrigerant lines that connect the two systems.
35
36 Depending on where you live, the parts that make up the system will change. The components listed
37 below are found in the typical heat-pump/air conditioning setups.
38
39 Blower motor: Moves air through the connected ductwork to circulate throughout the home.
40 • Single and multi-speed motors will run at set revolutions per minute (RPM) and are capable of
41 moving consistent amounts of air, measured in cubic feet per minute.
42 • Variable speed motors, sometimes known as an electronically commutated motor (ECM), monitor
43 changing conditions and adjust those outputs for maximized efficiency.
44
45 Plenum connectors: These are air-collection boxes that connect the supply and return ductwork
46 throughout the home to the air handler.
47
48 Air filter: Air filters protect the internal components by capturing particulates from the incoming air.
49
50 Condensers
51
52 A condenser is a device or unit used to condense a gaseous substance into a liquid state through cooling.
53 In so doing, the latent heat is released by the substance and transferred to the surrounding environment.
54
55 The four main parts of refrigerating and air conditioning systems are the compressor, condenser,
56 throttling or expansion valve, and the evaporator. The refrigerant leaving the compressor is in the
57 gaseous state, and at a high pressure and temperature. This refrigerant then enters the condenser where
58 it loses the heat to the coolant that can be air or water. After passing through the condenser, the
59 refrigerant is condensed but still remains at high pressure. It comes out in a partially liquid and gaseousFlorida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle Chapter 8 - Know Your Building Code! : FBC-Mechanical
Reicon Publishing, LLC 181
1 state, then enters the throttling or expansion valve.
2
3 The three types of condensers are air cooled, water cooled, and evaporative. These are described below.
4
5 Air cooled condensers: Air cooled condensers are used in small units like household refrigerators, deep
6 freezers, water coolers, window air conditioners, split air conditioners, small-packaged air conditioners,
7 etc. These are used in plants where the cooling load is small and the total quantity of the refrigerant in the
8 refrigeration cycle is small. Air cooled condensers are also called coil condensers as they are usually
9 made of copper or aluminum coil. They occupy a comparatively larger space than water cooled
10 condensers. The two types of air-cooled condensers are natural convection and forced convection.
11 • In the natural convection type, the air flows over it in natural a way depending upon the
12 temperature of the condenser coil.
13 • In the forced air type, a fan operated by a motor blows air over the condenser coil.
14
15 Water cooled condensers: Water cooled condensers are used for large refrigerating plants, big,
16 packaged air conditioners, central air conditioning plants, etc. These are used in plants where cooling
17 loads are excessively high and a large quantity of refrigerant flows through the condenser. The three
18 types of water-cooled condensers are tube-in-tube or double pipe type, shell and coil type and shell and
19 tube type. In all these condensers the refrigerant flows through one side of the piping while the water
20 flows through the other side, cooling and condensing the refrigerant.
21
22 Evaporative condensers: Evaporative condensers are usually used in ice plants. They are a
23 combination of water cooled and air-cooled condensers. In these condensers, the hot refrigerant flows
24 through the coils. Water is sprayed over these coils. At the same time, the fan draws air from the bottom
25 side of the condenser and discharges it from the top side of the condenser. The spray water that comes
26 in contact with the condenser coil is evaporated, absorbs the heat from the condenser, and cools and
27 condenses the refrigerant. Evaporative condensers have the benefits of both water cooled and air-cooled
28 condensers, so they occupy less space. However, keeping the evaporative condensers clean and free of
29 scale is difficult and requires lots of maintenance. For this reason, they are not favored by HVAC
30 designers.
31
32 Ductwork
33
34 Ductwork channels conditioned air to vents, takes return air back into the system, and transports exhaust
35 air and waste heat to the exterior of a home. Ducts serve a triple purpose: They carry warmth in winter,
36 hold cool air in summer, and provide ventilation for better indoor air quality throughout the year. Because
37 they’re in use almost every day, the ducts need occasional maintenance to improve the longevity of the
38 heating and air conditioning equipment.
39
40 How it Works
41
42 The air conditioner (AC) processes two air sources: return air and supply air. Depending on the building’s
43 construction, there may also be exhaust air ducts in the home, especially if the home is a multi-story
44 building, but most single-family homes use only supply and return ducts. Supply air comes from outside
45 the building via the ventilation system. Return air goes through the filter and into ducts that mix it with
46 supply air in a space called the plenum. The air in the plenum cools slightly as it combines external air
47 and recirculated air, but it is not until the air moves over the evaporator coils that it loses most of its heat.
48
49 The ducts that carry air to vents are separate from the return air ducts that bring air to the plenum and
50 through the main blower. The filters that remove smoke, dust, and other particulate matter from return air
51 serve a vital purpose and help keep the AC system’s coils clean. Clean coils are efficient coils, because
52 the evaporator coils carry coolant ready for its freight of excess heat, the coils’ fins must be free of soil
53 that could hamper thermal transfer.
54Chapter 8 - Know Your Building Code! : FBC-Mechanical Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
182 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 Types of Air Ducts
2
3 The two major types of air ducts are defined below.
4
5 Rigid ducts: Rigid ducts are typically more expensive to install, but they are durable and quiet if the
6 home has the space for them. Rigid materials are also easy to seal and clean. For forced-air systems,
7 rigid materials maintain air pressure better than flexible options, which is why many homes use them for
8 main trunk ductwork and use flexible materials for offshoots. The most common material for rigid ducting
9 is galvanized steel, but polyurethane panels with additional insulation are becoming increasingly popular
10 for new construction. Fiberglass panels are another possibility for rigid duct systems; they are well
11 insulated and lightweight.
12
13 Flexible ducts: Flexible ducting, or flex, allows the AC installation specialist to fit ducts into smaller
14 spaces and around existing architectural elements. Flex ducts are economical and compact, making them
15 a good choice for reaching vents near corners or close to the house’s eaves. Today, most flexible ducts
16 are made from metal coils wrapped with insulating materials and polyethylene plastic, but older ducts may
17 incorporate other plastics and metal films. When installing flexible ducts, ventilation technicians should
18 avoid bending or kinking the wire within the tubing. Over short distances of under 15 feet and with no
19 sharp bends, flexible ducts can approach the efficiency of rigid duct materials.
20
21 OTHER SYSTEMS
22
23 Exhaust Systems
24
25 An exhaust system is defined as, an assembly of connected ducts, plenums, fittings, registers, grilles, and
26 hoods through which air is conducted from the space or spaces and exhausted to the outdoor
27 atmosphere. It also serves to extract water and greasy vapor, smoke, fumes, toxic gases, obnoxious
28 odors, heat, and aerosols out of the building. An exhaust system is found in kitchens, bathrooms, or any
29 area that has a combustible energy source.

26 Ventilation systems shall be designed to have the capacity to supply the minimum outdoor airflow rate,
27 determined in accordance with this section. In each occupiable space, the ventilation system shall be
28 designed to deliver the required rate of outdoor airflow to the breathing zone. The occupant load utilized
29 for design of the ventilation system shall be not less than the number determined from the estimated
30 maximum occupant load rate indicated in Table 403.3.1.1. Ventilation rates for occupancies not
31 represented in Table 403.3.1.1 shall be those for a listed occupancy classification that is most similar in
32 terms of occupant density, activities and building construction; or shall be determined by an approved
33 engineering analysis. The ventilation system shall be designed to supply the required rate of ventilation
34 air continuously during the period the building is occupied, except as otherwise stated in other provisions
35 of the code.
36
37 With the exception of smoking lounges, the ventilation rates in Table 403.3.1.1 are based on the absence
38 of smoking in occupiable spaces. Where smoking is anticipated in a space other than a smoking lounge,
39 the ventilation system serving the space shall be designed to provide ventilation over and above that
40 required by Table 403.3.1.1 in accordance with accepted engineering practice.
41
42 Exception: The occupant load is not required to be determined based on the estimated maximum
43 occupant load rate indicated in Table 403.3.1.1 where approved statistical data document the accuracy of
44 an alternate anticipated occupant density.
45
46 Exhaust Hoods
47
48 An exhaust hood is a device containing a mechanical fan that hangs above the stove or cooktop in the
49 kitchen. It removes airborne grease, combustion products, fumes, smoke, heat, and steam from the air by
50 evacuation of the air and filtration. In commercial kitchens, exhaust hoods are often used in combination
51 with fire suppression devices so that fumes from a grease fire are properly vented and the fire is put out
52 quickly. Commercial vent hoods may also be combined with a fresh air fan that draws in exterior air,
53 circulating it with the cooking fumes that are then drawn out by the hood.
54
55 In most exhaust hoods, a filtration system removes grease (the grease trap) and other particles. Although
56 many vents hoods exhaust air to the outside, some recirculate the air to the kitchen. In a recirculating
57 system, filters may be used to remove odors in addition to the grease.

59 SPLIT AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS
60Chapter 8 - Know Your Building Code! : FBC-Mechanical Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
186 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 How does a Typical Split System Work?
2
3 A split air condition system is named as such because it has components that are located inside and
4 outside the home. It’s literally split into two pieces. It is as referred to as “central air.”
5
6 Consisting of an outdoor unit with a condenser and compressor, and an indoor unit with a fan and an
7 evaporator coil, a split air conditioning system works by removing warm air from a home and cycling it
8 back as cooler air through a system of supply and return ducts. Powered by electricity, the compressor
9 pumps refrigerant through the system to collect heat and moisture inside the home. That heat and
10 moisture is removed from the home when the warm air collected inside is blown over the cooled indoor
11 coil that cools the air. The heat transferred into the coil during this process is pumped outside the home,
12 while the cool air is cycled back inside.
13
14 A split air conditioning system is particularly effective in warmer climates, as it effectively keeps homes
15 cool and reduces humidity levels. It also features a lower indoor noise level compared to free-standing air
16 conditioning units, since its compressor-bearing unit is outside of the home. Central air conditioning
17 systems, such as a split system, provide the added benefit of air filtration because, as a “forced air”
18 system, air is drawn out of rooms through air returns and pulled through an air filter. This removes
19 airborne particles and results in cleaner, filtered air being redistributed to the home through air supply
20 ductwork.
21
22 Transfer the Heat
23
24 Heat is the amount of energy transferred due to temperature difference between two bodies. HVAC
25 equipment transfers thermal (heat) energy from one location to another.
26
27 Heat flows from areas of high temperature to areas of low temperature, according to the Second Law of
28 Thermodynamics. The HVAC system is responsible for reversing this natural flow, removing hot air from
29 buildings in the hot summers and placing it in buildings in the cold winters.
30
31 How does that happen? It’s all about the heat exchanger. A heat exchanger is a device that transfers
32 thermal energy from one medium to another.
33
34 How does a freon system work?
35
36 Refrigerant is a general term that refers to a chemical blend inside an electro-mechanical air conditioner
37 that can shift easily between liquid and gaseous states. The earliest refrigerants were toxic or
38 combustible, which made air conditioning impractical outside of industrial buildings. But the invention of
39 the first non-toxic refrigerant blend, known by the trademarked name Freon, allowed air conditioners to
40 enter home use and spread across the country. The current standard refrigerant blend for residential air
41 conditioners is R-410A, sometimes called Puron, which produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than
42 the previous blend, R-22.
43
44 As refrigerant transmutes from liquid to gas and back, it absorbs and releases heat. This is how it is
45 capable of cooling down a home. The compressor changes liquid refrigerant into a high-pressure, high-
46 temperature gas. The refrigerant moves to the outside coil of the air conditioner and releases its heat
47 there through condensation, cooling down. By the time it reaches the indoor coil, it has cooled down to
48 the point that it causes evaporation when it meets the warmer indoor air. This siphons heat from the air,
49 cooling it down. The refrigerant, once again a liquid, returns to the compressor to restart the cycle.
50
51 The refrigerant will remain at the same level for the life of the air conditioner unless leaks occur. If the
52 refrigerant level (its charge) starts to drop, professionals need to repair the system as soon as possible.
53 Low refrigerant will not only lower the cooling ability of the AC, but it can also severely damage the
54 compressor.

28 THE EVOLUTION OF MECHANICAL SYSTEMS
29
30 The Original - Ice on the Roof
31
32 In the 1830s, at the Florida hospital where he worked, Dr. John Gorrie built an ice-making machine that
33 used compression to make buckets of ice and then blew air over them. He patented the idea in 1851,
34 imagining his invention cooling buildings all over the world. But without any financial backing, his dream
35 melted away.
36
37 In 1881, after an assassin shot President James Garfield on July 2nd, naval engineers built a boxy
38 makeshift cooling unit to keep him cool and comfortable. The device was filled with water-soaked cloth
39 and a fan that blew hot air overhead and kept the cool air closer to the ground. The good news: This
40 device could lower room temperature by up to 20 degrees F. The bad news: It used a half-million pounds
41 of ice in two months … and President Garfield still died.
42
43 Systems Through Time
44
45 The Romans and Greeks used similar tactics to keep themselves cool. Though it was not until technology
46 accommodated advancements that the heating and air conditioning, we know today began taking shape.
47 1830s - Dr. John Gorrie of Florida wanted to provide a way to shorten recovery time for patients.
48 Believing that bad air was the root of illness, Gorrie used buckets of ice then blew air over them, resulting
49 in a cooling effect.
50 1861 - William Siemens learned how to super heat coils with electricity. He installed a fan to blow air
51 through it, inventing the first electric furnace.
52 1881 – After President James Garfield was shot, to provide him relief, naval engineers soaked pieces of
53 cloth in cold water and ice, then spun a fan over them.
54 1902 - Willis Carrier of New York invented an apparatus of chilled coils to control the temperature and
55 humidity of a room. This machine was primarily utilized in businesses where high temperature and
56 humidity levels ruined products, like ink and paper.Chapter 8 - Know Your Building Code! : FBC-Mechanical Florida CILB 14-Hr CE Bundle
188 Reicon Publishing, LLC
1 • Carrier’s first air conditioning units were large, costly, and dangerous as they used significant
2 amounts of ammonia. These units are used only in sizeable buildings like hotels, textile mills, and
3 hospitals.
4 1914 - The first air-conditioned home was in Minneapolis, MN. Unfortunately, the HVAC unit was still
5 enormous. It towered at 7 feet and ran 20 feet along the room.
6 • For the next fifteen years, movie theaters were outfitted with heating and cooling systems. Being
7 able to provide a cool environment increased sales and attendance dramatically during the
8 summer, allowing businesses to boom all year round.
9 1922 - Willis Carrier made two huge upgrades to his heating and cooling unit system. First, he replaced
10 ammonia with dyeline, a safer coolant for heating and air conditioning. Then, he reduced the size of the
11 unit. This allowed for HVAC to be available in more places like office suites, shopping malls, and railroad
12 cars.
13 • Within the next few years, central buildings like the House of Representatives, White House, and
14 Executive Office Building were fitted with HVAC.
15 • Unfortunately, rapid advancements for heating and air conditioning stopped. With the start of
16 World War II, commerce shifted toward producing military equipment. However, once the war was
17 over, Americans found that the economy was stronger than ever. There was an enormous surge
18 of sales in home heating and air conditioning.
19 1942 - The U.S. built a power plant specifically to keep up with the growing load of electricity demanded
20 from heating and air conditioning.
21 1953 - Over one million HVAC units were sold.
22 1950s - Improvements to the heating and cooling systems continued to be made. By the late 1950s,
23 motors were made to work more quietly, refrigeration was more efficient, and the HVAC unit was
24 relatively compact.
25 1970s - The central air system took over single heating and cooling units.
26 2011 - Up to 100 million American homes had heating and air conditioning. Experts and engineers in the
27 HVAC industry continued to make improvements, making it safer, smarter, and easier to heat and cool
28 buildings.
